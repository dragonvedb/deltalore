**IN DELTARUNE**, FRIEND is a strange face with a large smile and two eye, the colours of which resemble the colours of <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton's</a> glasses.

It briefly appears once in the darkness of the Queen's Mansion basement, before fading away.

Two Spamton Sweepstakes pages involve FRIEND:

FRIEND's eyes can rarely appear when clicking on the chair in /chair/.

FRIEND can rarely appear in the /rarecats/ minigame. It sets players score to zero and ends the game.

The name of the sprite in the game files is 'IMAGE\_FRIEND', which suggests it is a part of the <a onclick="loadFile('DEVICE.md')">DEVICE</a>. The significance of this is unknown.
