**IN DELTARUNE**, Father Alvin is the priest of Hometown and the son of <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson Boom</a>. He has a relative named Ms. Boom, who seems to Berdly's supervisor at some job of his; it's unclear whether she is Alvin's daughter, sister, mother or some other relative.
- _Gerson was the only character in UT who spoke of Delta Rune and <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>. In DR, his son is the one worshipping the Angel in a <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a> with a part of the Delta Rune symbol on it. Coincidence?.._

In Ch1 Alvin stands near the <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a>. When talked to he mentions that <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> used to sing in the choir and laments that <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> doesn't participate in the religious activities of the community. As a farewell, he wishes that the Angel's power lights their way.
- _Could this be reference to the save points? They are described as points of light that fill Kris with power._
	- _Especially if considering that the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Player</a> might be the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>._

Additionally, an old drawing made by Alvin, likely depicting Gerson, can be found in the unused classroom.

In Ch2 Alvin stands by his father's grave in the cemetery. As <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a> leave, they hear him muttering "...were you proud of me, father...? And... is it right for this hammer to..."
- _The hammer is buried in <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson.md')">Gerson's</a> grave to symbolise his life (he was a smith) and achievements (wrote the 'Lord of the Hammer' book series). Why does Alvin mention it?_
	- _Could Alvin be <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">the Knight</a>, opening fountains using his father's hammer?_
		- _According to <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Legend of Delta Rune</a>, fixing the balance of Light and Dark requires banishing the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel's</a> <a onclick="loadFile('Heaven.md')">Heaven</a> - and Father Alvin is a servant of the Angel._
		- _Alvin reveres Gerson for having a talent for crafting stories that "blossom into such a large, wonderful, world-changing thing..." If <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark Worlds</a> are taken to be a kind of fiction, perhaps Alvin is trying to follow in his father's footsteps?_
			- _Perhaps Gerson himself knew how to create Dark Worlds?_
		- _<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> says "SPEAKING OF \[\[Communion]] KRIS, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE KNIGHT...", but is apparently prevented from speaking by some outside force. The ritual of communion seems is performed by a priest and seems to be a part of Hometown's religion._
