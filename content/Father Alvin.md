IN DELTARUNE Father Alvin is the priest of Hometown and the son of [[Gerson Boom]]. He has a relative named Ms. Boom, who seems to Berdly's supervisor at some job of his; it's unclear whether she is Alvin's daughter, sister, mother or some other relative.
- _Gerson was the only character in UT who spoke of Deltarune and [[Angel]]. In DR, his son is the one worshipping the Angel in a [[Church]] with a Deltarune symbol on it. Is this a coincidence?_

In Ch1 he stands near the [[Church]]. When talked to he mentions that [[Asriel]] used to sing in the choir and laments that Kris doesn't participate in the religious activities of the community. As a farewell, he wishes that the Angel's power lights their way.
- _Could this be reference to the save points? They are described as points of light that fill one with power._
	- _Especially if you consider that the [[Red Soul|Player]] might be the [[Angel]]._

In Ch2 he stands by his father's grave in the cemetery. As Kris and [[Susie]] leave, they hear Father Alvin muttering "...would it be right for this hammer to..."
- _In UT, 'Hammer of Justice' was Gerson's nickname during the war. Did he wield a battle hammer in DR too? Or does Alvin mean somethin else?_ 
	- _If the hammer is indeed a weapon, could Alvin use it to open a Dark Fountain? Could he be the [[Knight]]?_
