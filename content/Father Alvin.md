**IN DELTARUNE**, Father Alvin is the priest of Hometown and the son of <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson Boom</a>. He has a relative named Ms. Boom, who seems to Berdly's supervisor at some job of his; it's unclear whether she is Alvin's daughter, sister, mother or some other relative.
- _Gerson was the only character in UT who spoke of Deltarune and <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>. In DR, his son is the one worshipping the Angel in a <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a> with a Deltarune symbol on it. Is this a coincidence?_

In Ch1 Alvin stands near the <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a>. When talked to he mentions that <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> used to sing in the choir and laments that Kris doesn't participate in the religious activities of the community. As a farewell, he wishes that the Angel's power lights their way.

	- _Especially if you consider that the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Player</a> might be the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>._

In Ch2 Alvin stands by his father's grave in the cemetery. As Kris and <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a> leave, they hear him muttering "...would it be right for this hammer to..."
- _In UT, 'Hammer of Justice' was Gerson's nickname during the war. Did he wield a battle hammer in DR too? Or does Alvin mean somethin else?_ 
	- _If the hammer is indeed a weapon, could Alvin use it to open a Dark Fountain? Could he be the <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">Knight</a>?_
