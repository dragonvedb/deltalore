**IN UNDERTALE**, the phrase "don't forget" is written on a drawing found in <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\' Workshop.md')">Sans's Workshop</a>. The drawing depicts three people. Curiously, it appears only after speaking to <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">Clam Girl</a>.

**IN DELTARUNE**, "Don't Forget" is a song that plays at the end of Ch1. 
The lyrics are:
*When the light is running low and the shadows start to grow*
*And the places that you know seem like fantasy*
*There's a light inside your soul*
*That's still shining in the cold with the truth*
*The promise in our hearts*
*Don't forget, I'm with you in the dark*

    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> forgot the name of a 'SPECIAL' <a onclick="loadFile('Egg.md')">egg</a> she received in Cat Petterz._
