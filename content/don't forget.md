In UNDERTALE, the phrase "don't forget" is written on a drawing found in[[ Sans' Workshop]]. The drawing depicts three people. Strangely, it appears only after speaking to [[Clam Girl]].
- _Considering that Clam Girl probably foreshadows DELTARUNE, could the drawing be of the three heroes of the [[Prophecy]]?_

In DELTARUNE, "Don't Forget" is a song that plays at the end of Ch1. 

The lyrics are:
*When the light is running low and the shadows start to grow*
*And the places that you know seem like fantasy*
*There's a light inside your soul*
*That's still shining in the cold with the truth*
*The promise in our hearts*
*Don't forget, I'm with you in the dark*

- _Who is singing these words? [[Ralsei]]? [[Dess Holiday|Dess]]? [[The Fallen Child (Chara)|Chara]]? [[Knight|The Knight]]?_
