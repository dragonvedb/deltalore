In DELTARUNE, "Don't Forget" is a song that plays at the end of Ch1. 

The lyrics are:
*When the light is running low and the shadows start to grow*
*And the places that you know seem like fantasy*
*There's a light inside your soul*
*That's still shining in the cold with the truth*
*The promise in our hearts*
*Don't forget, I'm with you in the dark*
