**IN DELTARUNE** the Flower King is a flower shop run by <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>. The name is a reference to his regal position in UNDERTALE.

The business is going poorly. There is little money in the cash register and unpaid bills are strewn on the floor. A notice from the landlord (signed as "C.") indicates that Asgore is risking eviction.
- _Who is "C."? Will they play a larger role in the story?_
	- _One theory states that the landlord is Noelle's mother and that her name is Carol._

The second floor of the shop is Asgore's apartment. Most of the room is taken up by seven potted flowers kept inside glass containers to preserve them. The photo posted on the fridge hints that these flowers were part of Toriel's wedding bouquet. Their colors, arrangement and containers resemble those of the <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">six human souls</a> in Asgore's possession. The central flower, however, is golden and looks similar to <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>. The significance of this is unclear.

There's a fridge in the room with apparently nothing but a single pickle. However, opening it a second time reveals that there is also an egg there.
If an <a onclick="loadFile('Egg.md')">Egg</a> has been acquired in Ch1, Kris will place it inside after opening the fridge. Opening it a second time reveals that there are now two eggs.

On the far side of the room there is a locked double door. Inspecting the side of the building from outside reveals that there is a door in the back of the shop as well, blocked by flowers. It's unclear whether these are two different doors or not.
- _Will the Flower King host a Dark World in one of the future chapters?_
- _Note that special attention is drawn to the back door by a nearby NPC._
