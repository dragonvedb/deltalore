**IN DELTAARUNE**, Susie is <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris's</a> classmate and, presumably, one of the three heroes of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a>.

She is a relatively new student in the school, but has already developed a reputation as a bully and a troublemaker, close to being expelled. Kris was her target more often then others; during one encounter between them, Susie threatened to "make Kris disappear", and Kris responded with something that shocked Susie and forced her to back off.

On the other hand, Susie never picked on <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> (to latter's disappointment). Despite this, she seems to be mostly oblivious to Noelle's crush on her, and unsure about her own felings.

Susie's parents are never mentioned and she doesn't call them when asked to. She aslo appears to be perpetually hungry and even tries to consume inedible objects, like chalk. This might imply that she has a bad home life or is homeless.

In the beginning of Ch1, Susie again threatens to kill <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and the only thing that stops her is the grief this would cause <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>, who Susie thinks very highly of. Their previous history is unclear; at the end of Ch2 Susie asks if Toriel "remembers her too" and Toriel replies that she does, but it turns out she merely remembers hearing about Susie from <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>.

After letting Kris go, she asks them a question, but interrupts before they have a chance to respond and says "Don't bother answering. If you haven't gotten it by now... Your choices don't matter." This echoes the end of <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">Goner Maker sequence</a> and reiterates the themes of fate, and control found throughout DELTARUNE.

Once trapped inside the closet <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>, Susie initially denies her role as the hero of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a> and runs off to search for a way home on her own. Later, she willingly joins Lancer, considering the role of villain to be more appropriate for herself.
However, during her adventures, Susie gradually drops the mean, violent facade and creates strong bonds with <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> and other characters. In Ch2 she also learns a healing spell from Ralsei, even though for now it is too weak to be useful in actual combat.

One of Susie's defining traits is her willingness to reject Kris's -- and, by extension, Player's -- commands. For example, in Ch1 she attacks enemies without Player's input; in Ch2 she invents 'S-Actions' for herself, whereas previously only Kris could perform special actions; later she also doesn't let Kris decide who to go with after the group splits up and drags Ralsei away with her.

Each chapter also has a sequence, where the focus briefly shifts to follow Susie separately from the rest of the party. During these sequences, the Player is sometimes offered to choose what she should do or say, but the choice is illusory; Susie seems to hear the command, but dismisses it and acts on her own accord.

**IN UNDERTALE**, Susie does not appear.

However, <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">CLam Girl</a> mentions someone named Suzy, who is her neighbour's daughter. Clam Girl implores <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> to befriend Suzy and speculates that "In life's grand scheme, she might be why you came here in the first place".

In the Nintedo Switch version, released shortly before Survey Program, Clam Girl has a chance to turn into a goner with the words "the moment you meet her...is fast approaching".
