**IN DELTARUNE**, Spamton G. Spamton is the secret boss of Ch1 and a <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Crystal.md')">Shadow Crystal</a> holder.

Spamton used to be an ordinary and untalented Addison, until he got in contact with a mysterious stranger via the phone (Spamton refers to it as "\[\[Communion]] WITH \[\[Unintelligble Laughter]]"). The stranger somehow helped Spamton quickly become successful, respected, and even moved into a room in the Queen's Mansion.
- _Somewhere during this, Spamton seems to have first contacted <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> by sending her a Cat Petterz mod that corrupted the game._

However, one day, the stranger stopped talking to Spamton and his fortunes immediately turned. The deals stopped coming and Spamton ran out of money. At this time, he found a broken machine in the basement and began praying to it. Soon, he was was evicted from the Mansion and forced to live in the dumpster.
- _The sound that was coming from the phone after Spamton was evicted is described as 'garbage noise', same as <a onclick="loadFile('mus_smile.md')">mus\_smile</a>, a track associated with <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a>._

In the aftermath, Spamton went insane and became obsessed with making deals, achieving freedom and becoming a 'big shot', which he seems to equate with ascending to Heaven.

After meeting <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>, Spamton relises that they are a Lightner. He attacks Kris and tries to pressure them to give him the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Red Soul</a>, which he believes to be necessary for the ascension. When that fails, he instead convinces Kris to go take the disk from the machiine in the basement of Queen's basement, uploads himself onto it and asks them to insert the disk back.
- _A strange face with Spamton's eye colours named <a onclick="loadFile('FRIEND.md')">IMAGE\_FRIEND</a> briefly appears in the basement during this sequence. The significance of this is unknown._

The machine becomes Spamton's new body, which he calls Spamton NEO. Even though he has previously described the body as "HEAVEN-PIERCING", Spamton finds that it is still not enough to ascend and that he is still bound by strings (which are actually wires that power the machine). He breaks his deal with Kris and attacks them, once again trying to take their <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Soul</a>. The party can either damage the body enough to destroy it, or cut all of the wires (which makes Spamton believe he is finally about to become free, but actually just makes the machine shut down).

On the Weird route, Spamton actively encourages <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> to continue freezing Darkners to make Noelle stronger. After a certain number of enemies has been frozen, Spamton sells Kris the Thorn Ring (which he calls his 'commemorative ring'). The Thorn Ring allows Noelle to cast the Snowgrave spell.

Spamton then sneaks into the basement, uploads himself into the machine and takes over Queen's Mansion. When Kris comes to close the Dark Fountain, Spamton tries to stop them, but is frozen by Noelle.

- _Spamton regularly mentions someone named 'Mike' and the year 1997._
    - _This might be a reference to a commercial for 'Big Shot' soda featuring Mike Ditka, which first aired in 1997._
