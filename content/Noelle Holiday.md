**IN DELTARUNE**, Noelle Holiday is the younger child of the Holiday family and <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris's</a> childhood friend.


Noelle is the second-best student in class and is usually paired with Berdly for group projects. She is kind, soft and easily scared, which Kris used to exploit by constantly pranking her. As a kid, she was especially scared of <a onclick="loadFile('ICE-E.md')">ICE-E</a> and thought it was a cryptid. At the same time, Noelle is attracted to things that scare her, which is probably part of the reason she has a crush on <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a>.

She is going through difficult times at home, as her sister <a onclick="loadFile('Dess Holiday.md')">Dess</a> is missing, her father <a onclick="loadFile('Rudy Holiday.md')">Rudy</a> is hospitalized with an unknonw illness, and she is left one-on-one with her <a onclick="loadFile('Ms. Holiday.md')">strict mother</a>.

Noelle likes playing video games (especially _Dragon Blazers_ and _Cat Petterz_) and runs a blog dedicated to video game secrets and glitches. 
- _She seems to have a peculiar talent for stumbling upon said glitches and breaking the game in strange ways._
    - _In Dragon Blazers, Noelle is able to reach a door in an endless ice maze area. This door is not mentioned in any guide and there is no way to open it._
    - _In Cat Petterz, Noelle used to install so many mods, that the game would freeze._
        - _She has once found a strange 'SPECIAL' egg that would not hatch. Its description is similar to the <a onclick="loadFile('Egg.md')">Egg</a> given by the <a onclick="loadFile('Man Behind the Tree.md')">Man Behind the Tree</a>._
        - _<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> has previously contacted Noelle by sending her a Cat Petterz mod that spawned an single blue circle (Pipis) that rapidly multiplied, filling up the screen and forcing Noelle to restart the game._
        - _In one of the minigames, where the player has to catch cats that give different amount of points, Noelle once got a weird cat that gave her negative points._
            - _If Spamton Sweepstakes page /secretcats/ is representative of the minigame, the weird cat is <a onclick="loadFile('FRIEND.md')">FRIEND</a>_

In Ch2, Noelle ends up in a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>, where she becomes an Ice Mage. The Queen kidnaps and tries to recruit her in order to achieve world domination, claiming that Noelle is uniquely strong compared to other Lightners.

By the end of Ch2, Noelle grows more assertive and confident. However, this manifests differently depending on the route:

On normal route, Noelle stands up to the Queen and refuses to follow her plan. 
Later in the Light World, playing an RPG together with <a onclick="loadFile('Rudy Holiday.md')">Rudy</a>, she playfully insists he let her fight her own battles.

On the Weird Route, Noelle is emotionally abused by <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and forced to freeze enemies, under the pretense that this will make her stronger. This culminates in her equipping the Thorn Ring gifted by Spamton and using it to cast the Snowgrave spell on Berdly, and later on <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a>, freezing and presumably killing them both. 
Afterwards Noelle is shown to be more controlling, and outright rejects Rudy's offer to help with the game.
- _Weird Route might be interpreted as an extension of Noelle's ability to break video games (<a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark Worlds</a> are explicitly compared to games many times)._
- _Noelle is persistently associated with the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>, and is adressed as such by Spamton and one of the Addisons._
    - _In the Weird Route, Noelle seems to be able to hear Player's voice, the only character to do so. And 'Angel' might be in-universe term for the Player._
