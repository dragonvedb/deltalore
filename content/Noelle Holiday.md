**IN DELTARUNE**, Noelle Holiday is the younger child of the Holiday family and Kris's childhood friend.

She is kind, soft and easily scared, which Kris used to exploit by constantly pranking her. As a kid, she was especially scared of ICE-E and thought it was a cryptid. At the same time, she is attracted to things that scare her, which is probably part of the reason she has a crush on Susie.

She is going through difficult times at home, as her sister Dess is missing, her father Rudy is hospitalized with an unknonw illness and she is left one-on-one with her strict mother.

Noelle is the second-best student in class and is usually paired with Berdly for group projects.

She likes playing video games, especially searching for secrets and easter eggs. 

In Ch2, Noelle ends up in a Dark World, where she becomes an Ice Mage. The Queen kidnaps and tries to recruit her in order to achieve world domination, claiming that Noelle posseses unique powers compared to other Lightners.

By the end of Ch2 two, Noelle grows more assertive and confident. However, this manifests differently depending on the route:

On normal route, Noelle stands up to the Queen and refuses to do her bidding. Later in the Light World, playing an RPG together with Rudy, she playfully insists he let her fight her own battles.

On the Weird Route, Noelle is emotionally abused by Kris and forced to freeze enemies, under the pretense that this will make her stronger. This culminates in her equipping the Thorn Ring and using it to cast a Snowgrave spell on Berdly and Spamton, freezing and presumably killing them both. Afterwards Noelle is shown to be more controlling, and outright rejects Rudy's offer to help with the game.
