IN DELTARUNE, Pipis are strange elliptical blue creatures, described as *"an invasive species of freshwater clam"*.

They are created and used in battle by [[Spamton G. Spamton|Spamton]] in large quantities as projectiles. On the Weird Route, when Spamton takes over Queen's Mansion, it's rooms become filled with Pipis, who either attack the Fun Gang or explode when approached.

Before Ch2, Spamton sent Noelle a mod for Cat Petterz 2 that added Pipis to the game. It could reproduce on its own and quickly filled the screen, forcing Noelle to wipe her save file.
