IN UNDERTALE, the CORE is an enormous structure that uses the heat of Hotland to produce energy for all of Underground. It is cooled down with ice blocks sent from Snowdin by Ice Wolf.

The CORE was constructed by [[Doctor W. D. Gaster]]. It might be the machine that he fell into before being shattered across time and space.
