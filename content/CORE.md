**IN UNDERTALE**, the CORE is an enormous structure that uses the heat of Hotland to produce energy for all of Underground. It is cooled with ice blocks sent down from Snowdin by Ice Wolf. The inside consists of modular rooms that can be moved relative to each other.

The CORE was constructed by <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor W. D. Gaster</a>. It might be the machine that he fell into before being shattered across time and space.
