**IN DELTARUNE**, Shadow Crystals are items obtained after defeating Secret Bosses. They are described as being translucent, yet still casting a sharp shadow.

Looking through a Shadow Crystal while in the <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a> lets one glimpse the corresponding Light World location. 

Their function in the Light World (where they transform into glass shards) is less clear - they seem to show a distorted picture of reality, either allowing <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> to look through their own hand, as though they don't exist, or showing Susie as coldly glaring at them.

Both Dark World and Light World effects only trigger once per crystal; subsequent uses yield only "...but nothing happened" and "It doesn't seem very useful", as does using it in Castle Town.
- _What do the Crystals actually show?_
    - _A timeline where the Dark Worlds were never created?_
    - _The true nature of thing?_
    - _Or their nature as perceived by the viewer?_

The origins of Shadow Crystals are unclear. <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a> is surprised to learn that <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> had one, and believes <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> found his inside the NEO body (which is likely a drawing made by <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a>).

<a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a> predicts that <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> will find more enemies holding Shadow Crystals and asks to bring the Crystals to them, so that Seam can *"stitch together something incredible"*.
    - _Could this 'something' be the <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Mantle.md')">Shadow Mantle</a>?_

In the game files, there is an unused item called Pure Crystal with the description "The shadow purified by the cat". It can be combined with the Thorn Ring to create the Twisted Sword (another unused item).
