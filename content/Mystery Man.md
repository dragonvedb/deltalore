IN UNDERTALE, the Mystery Man is a character who is likely the current form of [[Doctor W. D. Gaster]]. He is located in the hidden room behind a gray door that has a 10% chance to appear in the Fake Hallway, which itself only appears if the [[Fun Events|Fun Value]] is at 66.

Interacting with the Mystery Man makes him change his expression and disappear while _snd_mysterygo_ plays (just like [[Gaster Followers|Gaster Follower #2]] and [[Clam Girl|Goner Claim Girl]]).
