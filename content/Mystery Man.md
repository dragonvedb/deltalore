IN UNDERTALE, the Mystery Man is a character who is likely the current form of <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor W. D. Gaster</a>. He is located in the hidden room behind a gray door that has a 10% chance to appear in the Fake Hallway, which itself only appears if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is at 66.

Interacting with the Mystery Man makes him change his expression and disappear while _snd_mysterygo_ plays (just like <a onclick="loadFile('Gaster Followers.md')">Gaster Follower #2</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">Goner Claim Girl</a>).
