**IN UNDERTALE**, the Mystery Man is a character who is widely considered to be <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor W. D. Gaster</a> (or, at least, his current form). He is located in the hidden room behind a gray door that has a 10% chance to appear in the Fake Hallway, which itself only appears if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is at 66.

Interacting with the Mystery Man makes him change his expression and disappear while *snd_mysterygo* plays (just like <a onclick="loadFile('Gaster Followers.md')">Gaster Follower #2</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">Goner Claim Girl</a>).

The <a onclick="loadFile('Pain Poem.md')">Pain Poem</a> seems to reference Mystery Man's appearance.
