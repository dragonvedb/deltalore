**IN DELTARUNE**, the Egg is an item given to Kris by the Man Behind the Tree. 

The Egg exhibits many unusual qualitites. It is the only item that doesn't change form when transitioning between Dark and Light worlds. Its description simply states "Not too important, not too unimportant". Using it only plays a weird sound, while throwing it away yields "What Egg?" and the Egg will reappear in inventory the next time Kris visits a Dark World.

In Ch1, Kris can put the Egg in Asgore's fridge inside the Flower King. Doing so results in two eggs appearing inside the fridge.
Checking the firdge two times without carrying the Egg makes one egg appear in the fridge. So does dropping the Egg before placing it inside. The significance of this inconsistent behaviour is unknown.

In Ch2, Kris can put the Egg into a pile of eggs in Sans's grocery store.

Also in Ch2, Temmie puts an egg on the classroom desk; interacting with it shows how many eggs has been collected so far. 

During the Spamton Sweepstakes, page /egg/ describes how Noelle received a white egg in the video game Cat Petterz. The egg was labeled 'SPECIAL' and also had a name that Noelle cannot remember. It couldn't be discarded, produced a noise when clicked and would not hatch into a creature. After sometime caring for it as if it was a normal animal, the egg disappeared with a note that it "left due to happiness".
