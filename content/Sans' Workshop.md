**IN UNDERTALE**, Sans' workshop is located in the back of skeleton brothers' house. The door is out of view and can be open with the Silver Key found in <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\' Room.md')">Sans's room</a>.

Inside is a number o enigmatic objects that further complicate <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans's</a> backstory.

One of the drawers in the room contains a photo album, where Sans appears together with many other unfamiliar people; after fighting <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, Frisk will also find a photo of themselves, Sans and all of their friends (presumably one that is shown in the end of the Pacifist route).
- _Are the photographs from <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans's</a> past or - as might be hinted by the post-Pacifist photo - from an alternate timeline?_
	- _Were other people depicted Sans's colleagues from his days as researcher?_

If the player talked to Clam Girl (one of the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Events</a>), the description changes; when inspecting the album, Frisk will notice a drawing sticking out of the binder. This drawing depicts three people and the words "<a onclick="loadFile('don\'t forget.md')">don't forget</a>" are written on it.
- _Who are the people depicted on the drawing?_
	- _Could they be the three heroes of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a>, considering that Clam Girl foreshadows DELTARUNE?_

Another drawer contains a badge.
- _Why is a badge there?_
	- _Perhaps its a badge from a lab coat?_

On top of the drawers lies a blueprint for an unknown device; the handwriting on it is illegible.
- _Illegible handwriting could refer either to <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> (who writes in 'chicken scratch') or to <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor Gaster</a> (the Wingdings font is unreadable and contains hand symbols)._

In the corner, there is a large broken machine, draped with cloth.
- _Toby Fox likely refered to this machine in one of his early tweets: "You've all seen the happiest outcome. Neither of them could fix the machine, no matter how hard they tried. No one can."_
	- _What is the purpose of the machine?_
		- _Time travelling?_
		- _Or travelling between parallel universes?_
	- _Is this the 'creation' that Gaster fell into?_
	- _Who was attempting to fix it? Sans and Alphys? Sans and <a onclick="loadFile('Paprus.md')">Papyrus</a>?_
	- _Does the tweet imply that fixing the machine could lead to a better ending than True Pacifist route?_
