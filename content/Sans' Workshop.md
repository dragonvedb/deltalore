**IN UNDERTALE**, Sans' workshop is located in the back of skeleton brothers' house. The door is out of view and can be open with the Silver Key found in <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\' Room.md')">|Sans's room</a>.

Inside is a number o enigmatic objects that further complicate Sans' backstory.

One of the drawers in the room contains a photo album, where Sans appears together with many other unfamiliar people; after fighting <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, Frisk will also find a photo of themselves, Sans and all of their friends (presumably one that is shown in the end of the Pacifist route). If the player talked to Clam Girl (one of the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Events</a>), the description changes; when inspecting the album, Frisk will notice a drawing sticking out of the binder. This drawing depicts three people and the words "<a onclick="loadFile('don\'t forget.md')">don't forget</a>" are written on it.
Another drawer contains a badge.
- _Are the photographs from Sans' past or - as might be hinted by the post-Pacifist photo - from an alternate timeline?_
	- _Were other people depicted Sans' colleagues from his days as researcher?_
- _Who are the people depicted on the drawing?_
	- _Could they be the three heroes of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a>, considering that Clam Girl might be foreshadowing DELTARUNE?
- _What's up with the badge?_
	- _Perhaps it's the kind of badge a scientist would wear on his lab coat?_

On top of the drawers lies a blueprint for an unknown device; the handwriting on it is illegible.
In the corner, there is a large
broken machine, draped with cloth.
Toby Fox mentioned the machine in an early tweet:

- _Who is the author of the blueprints? Is it the same person as the creator of the machine?_
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> is mentioned to have bad handwriting._
	- _Dr. Gaster writes in Wingdings script, which is unreadable to most people._
		- _"hand"-writing - <a onclick="loadFile('River Person.md')">River Person</a> might be referring to Gaster as "the man who speaks in hands"._
- _What is the machine's purpose? Why did it break?_
	- _Does Toby's tweet imply that fixing the machine could lead to a better ending then the Pacifist one?_
	- _Could it be the "creation" that Gaster fell into?_
	- _Who was trying to fix the machine? Sans, Papyrus, Alphys, people in the photo album?_
