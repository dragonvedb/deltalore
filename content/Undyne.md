**IN UNDERTALE**, Undyne is fish-like monster and one of the major bosses. As the leader of the Royal Guard, she spends her days patrolling the <a onclick="loadFile('.md')">Underground</a>, looking for humans and criminals. She was inspired to a life of heroism by <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson</a>, trained by <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>, and trains <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a> in turn, though she doesn't actually want him to be a part of the Guard.

Undyne stalks Frisk through Waterfall and challenges them to battle. If Frisk tries to flee, she chases after them, but ultimately becomes exhausted and gives up.

Undyne has unusually strong <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> for a monster. If Frisk reduces her health to 0 in battle, she clings to life and continues to fight. Eventually though, her body begins to melt from excess Determination (similarly to <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a>). 

In Genocide route, she loses all of her health after one hit, similarly to other major bosses. Realizing that Frisk is going to exterminate all monsters and humans, she pushes past her Determination limit and transforms into Undyne the Undying.

In True Pacifist route, Undyne overcomes her hatred of humans and befriends Frisk. With Frisk's help, she confesses her feelings to <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> and they begin dating.

IN DELTARUNE Undyne is the Police Chief. <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> was her predecessor and possibly her former boss, before being removed for unknown reasons.

In contrast to UNDERTALE, DT's Undyne doesn't inititaly know <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>. In Ch2 she asks Kris to deliver a box of heart-shaped candy to Alphys after she crashes her bike. The box is accompanied by a note that reads "_Get Well Soon_", addressed to the bike.

Kris has an option to tell Undyne about the Dark Worlds, to which she responds dismissively.

In the end of Ch2, Toriel calls the police - likely Undyne - because the tires of her car were slashed by Kris.
