IN DELTARUNE the "Pain Poem" is a series of rhyming error messages hidden in the game's code:

*"Is that a cut on your face or part of your eye?"
"The gash weaves down as if you cry."
"The pain itself is reason why."

The lines seem to describe the [[Mystery Man]].

The last line might be a reference to the text that appears during the [[Amalgamates|Memoryheads ]]battle in UT, "Lorem ipsum docet", which can be translated as "The pain itself teaches".
