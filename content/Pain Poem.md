**IN DELTARUNE**, the "Pain Poem" is a series of rhyming error messages hidden in the game's code:

- *"Is that a cut on your face or part of your eye?"*
- *"The gash weaves down as if you cry."*
- *"The pain itself is reason why."*

The lines seem to describe the <a onclick="loadFile('Mystery Man.md')">Mystery Man</a>.

The last line might be a reference to the text that appears during the <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Memoryheads </a>battle in UT, "Lorem ipsum docet", which can be translated as "The pain itself teaches".
