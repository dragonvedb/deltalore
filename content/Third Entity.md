IN DELTARUNE Third Entity refers to an unknown character (neither [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Gaster]] nor [[Red Soul|Player]]), who interrupts the [[Goner Maker]] sequence, discards the [[Vessel]] and tells the Player that *"no one can choose who they are in this world"*, thus introducing the themes of fate and freedom that run through the entire game.

The existence of the Third Entity is disputed. Some think that the voice at the end of Goner Maker is still Gaster's, while opponents point to an abrupt change in tone and font as evidence.
	
- _If the Third Entity does exist, what are their goals? Are they working against Gaster? Or is their intervention a part of the plan?_
	- _Do they continue somehow influencing Kris and the story after the Goner Maker sequence?_
- _Is the Third Entity a character we are aware of?_
	- *Is it [[The Fallen Child (Chara)|Chara]]?* 
		- _They are already known to be a strange entity with no physical form and they do wish to move on to other worlds in the end of UT's [[Genocide Route]]_.
		- _Analysis of spelling patterns in Japanese version might support this theory._
	- *Is it [[Ralsei]]?*
	- _Is it [[Kris]]?_
	- *Is it the [[Knight]]?*
