**IN DELTARUNE**, Third Entity refers to an unknown character (neither <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a> nor <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Player</a>), who interrupts the <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">Goner Maker</a> sequence, discards the <a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">Vessel</a> and tells the Player that *"no one can choose who they are in this world"*, thus introducing the themes of fate and freedom that run throughout the rest game.

The existence of the Third Entity is disputed. Some think that the voice at the end of Goner Maker is still Gaster's. The abrupt change in tone and font is usually used as evidence for the Third Entity.
