**IN UNDERTALE**, Redacted is the name given to a sprite located in an unused room *room_water_redacted* that can only be accessed through game files manipulation. 

It fades in as Frisk approaches and intereacting with it yields '* \[redacted]' in Wingdings.

Exiting the room leads to the <a onclick="loadFile('Sound Test.md')">Sound Test</a>.

- _It is unknown if Redacted is part of the <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">W. D. Gaster</a> metaplot or truly cut content._
