**IN UNDERTALE**, the Anomaly is either an entity or a phenomenon that causes the timelines to behave weirdly and then unexpectedly terminate.

Tha Anomaly is mentioned only by Sans on the Genocide route:

Our reports showed a massive anomaly in the time-space continuum.
Timelines jumping left and right, stopping and starting...
Until suddenly, everything ends.
Heheheh...
That's your fault, isn't it?

Sans believes Frisk to be the Anomaly, but doesn't kill them on sight because of the promise he made to Toriel. Only during Genocide does he decide to intervene, since the alternative would be the end of the world.

- _Where and with whom did Sans research timelines?_
    - _With Alphys? But she seems to think that the existance of alternate universes is only theoretical._
    - _With Dr. W. D. Gaster?_
    - _With the people on the photo in Sans's Workshop?_
- _Who really is the Anomaly?_
    - _Is it Frisk, like Sans assumes?_
        - _Or the player controlling Frisk?_
    - _Is it Flowey? He was messing with the timelines for far longer than Frisk._
    - _Is it Chara? They are the ones who erase the world at the end of Genocide, which Sans warns will be the result of the Anomaly's actions._
- _How does Sans know when Frisk's kill count is enough to trigger Chara destroying the world?_
