**IN UNDERTALE**, the Anomaly is either an entity or a phenomenon that causes the timelines to behave weirdly and then unexpectedly terminate.

Tha Anomaly is mentioned exlusively by <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> on the Genocide route:

*Our reports showed a massive anomaly in the time-space continuum.*
*Timelines jumping left and right, stopping and starting...*
*Until suddenly, everything ends.*
*Heheheh...*
*That's your fault, isn't it?*

<a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> believes <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> to be the Anomaly, but doesn't kill them on sight because of the promise he made to <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>. Only during Genocide does he decide to intervene, since the alternative would be the end of the world.

- _Who really is the Anomaly?_
    - _Is it <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a>, like <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> assumes?_
        - _Or the player controlling Frisk?_
    - _Is it <a onclick="loadFile('Fowey.md')">Flowey</a>?_
    - _Is it <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a>? They are the ones who erase the world at the end of Genocide._
    - _Note that all four options are candidates for being the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>_
- _How does Sans know when Frisk's kill count is enough to result in Chara destroying the world?_
