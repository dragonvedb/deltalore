IN UNDERTALE, misplaced calls are a series of [[Fun Events]] that can occur in Snowdin. One comes from an unknown caller, two others come from [[Sans]] and [[Alphys]].
- _Could the calls be coming from the past or the future? Or from another universe entirely?_
- _Note that both Alphys and Sans have connections to the [[Hotland Lab]] and [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|W. D. Gaster]]._

**The list of misplaced calls with their respective Fun Values:**

- **(2-39) Wrong Number Song** - an unknown person calls [[Frisk]] and asks for someone whose name starts with "G", but then cuts themselves off without saying the full name, realizing they've called the wrong number. Then the "Wrong Number Song" plays.
	- _Who is the caller?
	- _Who were they trying to reach?
		- _Gyftrot?_
		- _[[Gerson Boom|Gerson]]?_
		- _[[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Gaster]]?_
  
- **(40-45) Sans's Call** - [[Sans]] calls Frisk and asks if their refrigerator is running. If the response is positive, he offers to "deposit the brewskis," and if it is negative, to "send someone over to fix it."
	- _Who was Sans actually calling?_
		- _Alphys? There are many fridges in the [[Hotland Lab|True Lab]], after all._
  
- **(46-50) Alphys's Call** - [[Alphys]] mistakenly calls Frisk while trying to order a pizza, and accidentally sends out ASCII-art of an anime catgirl.
