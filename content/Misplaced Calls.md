**IN UNDERTALE**, misplaced calls are a series of <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Events</a> that can occur in Snowdin. One comes from an unknown caller, two others come from <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>.
- _Note that both Alphys and Sans have connections to the <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">Hotland Lab</a> and to <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">W. D. Gaster</a>._

**The list of misplaced calls with their respective Fun Values:**

- **(2-39) Wrong Number Song** - an unknown person calls <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> and asks for someone whose name starts with "G", but then cuts themselves off without saying the full name, realizing they've called the wrong number. Then the "Wrong Number Song" plays.
	- _Though it's unknown whom the caller was trying to reach, the most obvious hypothesis is Gaster._
  
- **(40-45) Sans's Call** - <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> calls Frisk and asks if their refrigerator is running. If the response is positive, he offers to "deposit the brewskis," and if it is negative, to "send someone over to fix it."
	- _Who was Sans actually calling?_
		- _It could be Alphys, since Sans knows her and the Lab where she works has a room with multiple fridges._
  
- **(46-50) Alphys's Call** - <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> mistakenly calls Frisk while trying to order a pizza, and accidentally sends out ASCII-art of an anime catgirl.
