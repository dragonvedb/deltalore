IN UNDERTALE River Person is a character who carries passengers between Snowdin, Waterfall and Hotland by boat. Their appearance is hidden by a hooded cloak; their gender and name are unknown, and they themselves state that those are unimportant.

Whenever Frisk takes a ride, the River Person says a random phrase, which range from small observations to cryptic hints (like the directions to Temmie Village).

These messages are of particular note:

- _Tra la la. Beware of the man who speaks in hands._ 
	- Possibly refers to W. D. Gaster, since his dialogue is rendered in upper-case Wingdings, which include several hand symbols (like left-pointing hand in place of D).
- _Tra la la. Beware of the man who came from the other world._ 
	- Possibly refers to [[Sans]], as there are several hints that he is not originally from UNDERTALE's universe.
- _Tra la la. Did you ever hear the old song coming from the sea?_ 
	- In DELTARUNE, [[Onion]] talks about a familiar song "coming from the sea".
- _Tra la la. The angel is coming... Tra la la._ 
	- Though UNDERTALE also has a prophecy regarding an angel, this line might foreshadow DELTARUNE's Roaring.
