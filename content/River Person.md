**IN UNDERTALE**, River Person is a character who carries passengers between Snowdin, Waterfall and Hotland by boat. Their appearance is hidden by a hooded cloak; their gender and name are unknown, and they state that those are unimportant.

Whenever Frisk takes a ride, the River Person says a random phrase, which range from small observations to cryptic hints (like the directions to Temmie Village).

These messages are of particular note:

- Tra la la. Beware of the man who speaks in hands. 
	- _Possibly refers to W. D. Gaster, since his dialogue is rendered in upper-case Wingdings, which include several hand symbols (like left-pointing hand in place of D)._
- Tra la la. Beware of the man who came from the other world.
	- _Possibly refers to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a>, as there are several hints that he is not originally from UNDERTALE's universe._
- Tra la la. Did you ever hear the old song coming from the sea?
	- _In DELTARUNE, <a onclick="loadFile('Onion.md')">Onion</a> talks about a familiar song "coming from the sea"._
- Tra la la. The angel is coming... Tra la la.
	- _Both UT and DR have a <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> involving an <a onclick="loadFile('Onion.md')">Angel</a>._
