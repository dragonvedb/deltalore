**IN UNDERTALE**, Flowey is the first golden flower that grew in <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore's</a> garden. Presumably, its seed clung to <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> when he returned from the surface and absorbed his essense after he died. It gained sentience after <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> injected it with <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a>, aiming to create a vessel for <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Souls</a> that was neither human nor monster.

Alphys eventually concluded that the experiment was a failure and returned Flowey to Asgore's garden, where he awoke sometime later with Asriel's memories and personality. He initially tried to live something resembling a normal life, first with Asgore and then with Toriel, but was unable to feel any empathy or love dut to lacking a Soul. Desperate, he tried to commit suicide, but instead Reset back to the time he first woke in the garden.

Realising that his extremely high level of <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> allows him to manipulate the timeline by Saving and Loading, Flowey began to experiment with various courses of action to see what the outcome would be. At first, he used his abilities and foresight to make friends and solve their problems. But, as time went on, his growing frustration and boredom led him to abuse and murder monsters just to see what would happen afterwards.

After countless resets, Flowey feels like he has exhausted all the 'content' availible in the Underground and considers other people to be reducible to their lines of dialogue. 
The only person whom he believes he still feels something for is <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a>.

He has tried multiple times to steal <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore's</a> <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">human souls</a> to gain more power and be able to pass through the Barrier, but without success.

When <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> falls into the Underground, Flowey loses the ability to Save and Load, though he still retains his memories between Resets.
He meets Frisk in the first room of the Ruins and pretends to give friendly advice on how the battle system works. He then tries to kill Frisk, but is repelled by <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>.

On the neutral route, he decides to simply observe Frisk's actions. After Frisk fights <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>, Flowey intervenes, kills Asgore if Frisk hasn't done so and absorbs the six humans souls, turning into Omega Flowey. He takes the control of the timeline back from Frisk and traps them in a death loop. However, when Frisk pleads the Souls for help, they rebel against Flowey and leave him. 
In the aftermath, Flowey asks <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> to kill him. If they spare him, he appears after Sans's phonecall and give Frisk advice on how to reach the True Pacifist ending.

On repeated neutral routes, Flowey appears at the end to destroy Asgore's soul, but doesn't absorb the souls, as he knows it to be pointless.

On the True Pacifist route, Flowey manipulates <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a> into gathering all of Frisk's friends, alongside many regular monsters, in the Barrier room. Flowey traps them, absorbs their souls and turns into <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> once again.

Flowey appears one last time at the very end of the True Pacifist route. He speaks to someone (using whatever name was chosen at the start of the game, though it's unclear wheter he is talking to <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> or the player) and urges them not to ruin the happy ending by reseting.

On the Genocide route, Flowey believes Frisk to be a reincarnation of Chara and offers them a plan to steal <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">the Souls</a> and become all-powerful together. 
Only when <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> reaches New Home does Flowey realise that they are unlikely to spare him. He begs for mercy and tries to convince Frisk of his usefulness, but is killed anyway.

- _Though Flowey doesn't appear in DELTARUNE, one of the flowers on the second floor of <a onclick="loadFile('Flower King.md')">Flower King</a> looks very similar to him. It is surrounded by other flowers that are coloured like <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">the six human souls</a>._
- _<a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> (whose name is an anagram of <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">'Asriel'</a>) uses similar phrases to Flowey when teaching <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> the basics of combat._
    - _Ralsei also gives Kris advice on how to achieve the best ending and tries to steer the plot in that direction, similarly to what Flowey did with True Pacifist route._
