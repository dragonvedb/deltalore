IN DELTARUNE, Rudolph Holiday is [[Noelle Holiday|Noelle's]] father and husband of [[Ms. Holiday]].

Rudy is a jolly and easygoing man. He is very protective of [[Noelle Holiday|Noelle]] and worries that she is not prepared to defend herself against the world.

He is currently hospitalized with an unknown illness. The severity of it is unclear, though in Ch2 Rudy himself says that it's not serious and that he plans to go to Church tomorrow.

IN UNDERTALE, Rudy is mentioned only in unused Undertale Alarm Clock dialogue. There, it is revealed that he died some time before the events of the game. In life he was [[Asgore|Asgore's]] close friend and helped him deliver presents on Christmas.
