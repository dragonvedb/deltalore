**IN DELTARUNE**, the Depths refers to a hypothetical place where the darkness that shapes Dark Worlds comes from, as well as to persistent association of Dark Worlds with water.

The word 'depths' is used by Jevil, when he says "Soon, the Queen returns and hell's roar bubbles from the depths."

The background image of the Goner Maker sequence is named 'IMAGES_DEPTHS' and is a modified photo of the ocean waves.

In Ch1, when Kris wakes up in the Dark World, the sound named 'ocean.ogg' plays. The same sound also plays near the Lake in Ch2 and the /icepalace_glaceir/ Sweepstakes page.
Another Sweepstakes page, /chair/, plays a sound named 'water.ogg'. Its title reads "But what if could... get darker than dark?"

Onion, who lives in the Lake, talks about a song that comes "from under the water, deep" and says they heard this song before in the sea.
