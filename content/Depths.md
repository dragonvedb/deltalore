The word 'depths' is used by <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> when he says _"Soon, the Queen returns and hell's <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">roar</a> bubbles from the depths"_.

In Ch1, when <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> wakes up in the <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>, the sound named 'ocean.ogg' plays. The same sound also plays near the Lake in Ch2 and the */icepalace_glaceir/* Sweepstakes page.
Another Sweepstakes page, _/chair/_, plays a sound named 'water.ogg'. Its title reads _"But what if could... get darker than dark?"_
