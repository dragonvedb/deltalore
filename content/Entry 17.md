IN UNDERTALE Entry 17 can refer to two different texts hidden in the game files.

One of them is written by [[Alphys]] and describes how monsters melted together into [[Amalgamates]] after being injected with determination.

The second, more well-known one, can be seen by accessing hidden Room 264 aka _room_gaster_ and is presumably written by [[Doctor W. D. Gaster]]. The text prints out in shaking uppercase Wingdings font, while *[[mus_smile]]* is playing:

- _ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN_
- _DARK DARKER YET DARKER_
- _THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING_
- _THE SHADOWS CUTTING DEEPER_
- _PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE_
- _THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT_
- _SEEMS_
- _VERY_
- _VERY_
- _INTERESTING_
- _..._
- _WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK_

	- _What experiment is Gaster talking about?_
		- _The creation of a [[Dark Worlds|Dark World]]?_
			- _Or of the DELTARUNE timeline itself?_
		- _Was this the experiment that ended his life?_
	- _Who are the two people Gaster is addressing?_
		- _[[Sans]] and [[Papyrus]]?_
		- _Sans and [[Alphys]]?_

IN DELTARUNE the text of Entry 17 is referenced by [[Seam]]. They tell that after listening to [[Jevil ]](who likely communicated with Gaster at some point) their worldview became "darker, yet darker".
