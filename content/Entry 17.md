**IN UNDERTALE**, Entry 17 can refer to two different texts hidden in the game files.

One of them is written by <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> and describes how monsters melted together into <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a> after being injected with <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a>.

The second, more well-known one, can be seen by accessing hidden *room_gaster* and is presumably written by <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor W. D. Gaster</a>. The text prints out in shaking uppercase Wingdings font, while *<a onclick="loadFile('mus_smile.md')">mus_smile</a>* is playing:

_ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN_<br>
_DARK DARKER YET DARKER_<br>
_THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING_<br>
_THE SHADOWS CUTTING DEEPER_<br>
_PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE_<br>
_THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT_<br>
_SEEMS_<br>
_VERY_<br>
_VERY_<br>
_INTERESTING_<br>
_..._<br>
_WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK_

- _What experiment is Gaster talking about?_
	- _The creation of a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>?_
		- _Or of DELTARUNE itself?_
	- _Was this the experiment that ended his life?_
- _Who are the two people Gaster is addressing?_
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>?_
	- _Sans and <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>?_

**IN DELTARUNE**, the text of Entry 17 is referenced by <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a>. They say that after listening to <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> (who might have communicated with Gaster at some point) their worldview became "darker, yet darker".

An image named *him.png*, posted on *deltarune.com* years before the release of Ch1, displayed the words "THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT SEEMS VERY VERY INTERESTING".
