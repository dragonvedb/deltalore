IN UNDERTALE Entry 17 can refer to two different texts hidden in the game files.

One of them is written by <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> and describes how monsters melted together into <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a> after being injected with determination.

The second, more well-known one, can be seen by accessing hidden Room 264 aka _room_gaster_ and is presumably written by <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Doctor W. D. Gaster</a>. The text prints out in shaking uppercase Wingdings font, while *<a onclick="loadFile('mus_smile.md')">mus_smile</a>* is playing:

- _ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN_

- _..._
- _WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK_

	- _What experiment is Gaster talking about?_
		- _The creation of a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>?_
			- _Or of the DELTARUNE timeline itself?_
		- _Was this the experiment that ended his life?_
	- _Who are the two people Gaster is addressing?_
		- _<a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>?_
		- _Sans and <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>?_

IN DELTARUNE the text of Entry 17 is referenced by <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a>. They tell that after listening to <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> (who likely communicated with Gaster at some point) their worldview became "darker, yet darker".
