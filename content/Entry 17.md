IN UNDERTALE Entry 17 can refer to two different texts hidden in the game files.

One of them is written by [[Alphys]] and describes how monsters melted together into [[Amalgamates]] after being injected with determination.

The second, more well-known one, can be seen by accessing hidden Room 264 aka _room_gaster_ and is presumably written by [[Doctor W. D. Gaster]]. The text prints out in shaking uppercase Wingdings font, while *[[mus_smile]]* is playing:

_ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN_
_DARK DARKER YET DARKER_
_THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING_
_THE SHADOWS CUTTING DEEPER_
_PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE_
_THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT_
_SEEMS_
_VERY_
_VERY_
_INTERESTING_
_..._
_WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK_

- _What experiment is Gaster talking about?_
	- _The creation of a [[Dark Worlds|Dark World]]?_
		- _Or of the DELTARUNE timeline itself?_
	- _Was this the experiment that ended his life?_
- _Who are the two people Gaster is addressing?_
	- _[[Sans]] and [[Papyrus]]?_
	- _Sans and [[Alphys]]?_

IN DELTARUNE the text of Entry 17 is referenced by [[Seam]]. They tell that after listening to [[Jevil ]](who likely communicated with Gaster at some point) their worldview became "darker, yet darker".
