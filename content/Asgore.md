**IN UNDERTALE**, Asgore is Asriel's Father, Toriel's ex-husband and the reigning king of monsterkind, a position he held since at least the Human-Monster war. 

He is incredibly long-lived due to being a Boss Monster, a unique kind of monster who doesn't age, unless they have a living child. It also makes his Soul able to persist outside of his body for a short while. This means that any human must absorb his Soul in order to leave the Underground through the Barrier.

Even though Asgore and Gerson agreed that monsters should not try to return to the surface, after Asriel's death Asgore declared a war on humanity, promising to kill every human that fell into the Underground, absorb their Souls, break the Barrier (which require seven human souls) and exterminate humanity.

Disagreeing with Asgore's plan, Toriel left him.

Because of Asgore's generally kind and indecisive personality, he decided to delay the war as much as possible, by waiting until seven humans randomly fall into the Underground and preserving their Souls in glass containers, instead of absorbing the Soul of one, crossing the Barrier on his own and getting six more.

At some points during the wait, Asgore became best friends with Rudy Holiday, trained Undyne and appointed Alphys to the position of the Royal Scientist in place of W.D. Gaster.

On Neutral Route, Frisk eventually defeats Asgore. If they spare him, he briefly phantasises about raising Frisk as their own child together with Toriel, before either being killed by Flowey or comitting suicide to give Frisk the opportunity to leave the Underground and find a way to break the Barrier. In the latter case he also says he believes Frisk to be the Angel of the Prophecy.

In the True Pacifist ending, Asgore ends up working as a gardener in Toriel's school.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Asgore is also Kris's adoptive father. He is divorced from Toriel, but still feels affection towards her, just like in UT.

He was Hometown's former Police Chief (thus likely Undyne's former boss), before resigning for unknown reasons. Currently he runs the Flower King, though the buisiness is going poorly. 

Even though Dreemurs and Holidays grew distant over time, he is still close friends with Rudy.

Asgore is extremely nostalgic about the past, to the point where he still keeps the flowers from Toriel's wedding bouqet preserved in glass containers, reminiscent of how he preserved human Souls in UT.
