**IN UNDERTALE**, Asgore is <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel's</a> father, <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel's</a> ex-husband and the reigning King of monsterkind, a position he held since at least the Human-Monster war. 

He is incredibly long-lived due to being a Boss Monster, a unique kind of monster who doesn't age, unless they have a living child. It also makes his <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Soul</a> able to persist outside of his body for a short while. This means that any human must absorb his Soul in order to leave the Underground through the Barrier.

Even though Asgore and <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson</a> agreed that monsters should not try to return to the surface, after <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel's</a> death Asgore declared a war on humanity, promising to kill every human that fell into the Underground, absorb their Souls, break the Barrier (which requires seven human souls) and exterminate humanity.

Disagreeing with Asgore's plan, <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> left him and went into exile to the Ruins.

Because of Asgore's generally kind and indecisive personality, he decided to delay the war as much as possible, by waiting until seven humans randomly fall into the Underground and preserving their Souls in glass containers, instead of absorbing the Soul of one, crossing the Barrier on his own and acquiring six more.

At some points during the wait, Asgore became best friends with <a onclick="loadFile('Rudy Holiday.md')">Rudy Holiday</a>, trained <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a> and appointed <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> to the position of the Royal Scientist in place of <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">W.D. Gaster</a>.

On Neutral Route, <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> eventually defeats Asgore. If they spare him, he briefly phantasises about raising Frisk as their own child together with Toriel, before either being killed by <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> or comitting suicide to give Frisk the opportunity to leave the Underground and find a way to break the Barrier. In the latter case he also says he believes Frisk to be the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a> of the <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a>.

In the True Pacifist ending, Asgore ends up working as a gardener in <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel's</a> school.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Asgore is <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris's</a> adoptive father. He is divorced from <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>, but still feels affection towards her, just like in UT.

He was Hometown's former Police Chief (thus likely <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne's</a> former boss), before resigning for unknown reasons. Currently he runs the <a onclick="loadFile('Flower King.md')">Flower King</a>, though the buisiness is going poorly.
- _Why did Asgore resign?_
    - _Did it have something to do with Dess's disappearance?_

Even though Dreemurs and Holidays grew distant over time, he is still close friends with <a onclick="loadFile('Rudy Holiday.md')">Rudy</a>.

Asgore is extremely nostalgic about the past, to the point where he still keeps the flowers from Toriel's wedding bouqet preserved in glass containers. 
- _This is reminiscent of how he preserved human <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Souls</a> in UT._
