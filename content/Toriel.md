**IN UNDERTALE**, Toriel is Asriel's mother, Asgore's ex-wife and the former queen of monsterkind.

Following Asriel's death and Asgore declaring a war on humanity, Toriel left Asgore and her royal position. She retreated to Home, the monsters' now abandoned capital, and became the caretaker of the Ruins. She seems to have taken the Fallen Child's body with her and buried it on the spot where they fell into the Underground. Over time, she was largely forgotten.

Due to being a Boss Monster, Toriel doesn't age unless she has a living child. In the subsequent years she found and tried to care for humans who fall into the Underground. All of them eventually left her and all, except Frisk, died.

Toriel bonded with Sans over their mututal love of puns, thought they don't know each other's indentities, since they only speeak to each other thorugh the Ruins door. Toriel also asked Sans to protect any humans that exit the Ruins, which is one of the reason Sans didn't kill Frisk, despite believing them to be the Anomaly.

In the True Pacifist ending, Toriel becomes a teacher.

Toriel's Alarm Clock dialogue suggests she went through periods of severe depression and might be susceptible to alcoholism.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Toriel is Kris's adoptive mother and works as a school teacher. Just lik in UT, she is divorced from Asgore and rejects his attempts to mend their relationship (such as throwing away the bouqets he gifts her). She gets along well with Sans, even though he moved into Hometown very recently.

Toriel is protective of Kris, which is shown through things like holding their hand while walking from parking lot to class, participating as their partner in group projects, excessively worrying when they are late home, etc.

Toriel also seems to be rather religious.
Despite this, Rudy mentions that Toriel used to be a party animal in her college days.

Susie's dialogue suggests that she had some positive interaction with Toriel in the past, though Toriel doesn't seem to remember it.

At the end of Ch2 Toriel falls asleep in her armchair, before Kris opens a Dark Fountain in the same room. Presumably, she is going to end up in a Dark World in Ch3.
