IN UNDERTALE, Gaster Followers are three mysterious gray figures that have a chance to appear in Hotland at certain [[Fun Events|Fun Values]]. Each of them relays a part of Dr. Gaster's backstory. It is unknown who or what they are, how they are connected to Dr. Gaster, or why they look like subtly changed versions of other minor characters.

Below is a list of the followers with their respective dialogue and Fun Values:

- **61 *(20% chance)* - Gaster Follower #2** looks similar to the Scared Donut Guy, except instead of donut, they hold what looks like a small head, which they claim to be a piece of [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|W. D. Gaster]]. Interestingly, the head is actually the one speaking.
  This follower is somewhat different from the other two. They appear more rarely, speak in rhymes and immediately disappear after finishing their speech with the _snd_mysterygo_ sound (just like [[Mystery Man]] and [[Clam Girl|Goner Clam Girl]]). The meaning of these differences is unknown.
  Dialogue:
	- _[[Alphys]] might work faster. But the old Royal Scientist, Doctor W.D. Gaster?_
	- _One day, he vanished without a trace._
	- _They say he shattered across time and space._
	- _Ha ha... How can I say so without fear?_
	- _I'm holding a piece of him right here._

- **62 *(50% chance)* - Gaster Follower #1** looks similar to the Ficus Licker.
  Dialogue:
	- _It makes sense why [[ASGORE]] took so long to hire a new Royal Scientist._
	- _After all, the old one... Dr. Gaster. What an act to follow!_
	- _They say he created the [[CORE]]._
	- _However, his life... Was cut short._
	- _One day, he fell into his creation, and..._
	- _Will [[Alphys]] end up the same way?_
  

- **63 *(50% chance)* - Gaster Follower #3** has no analogue in UNDERTALE, but looks similar to the Striped Bird from DELTARUNE.
  Dialogue:
	- _I understand why [[ASGORE]] waited so long to hire a new Royal Scientist._
	- _The previous one... Dr. Gaster._
	- _His brilliance was irreplaceable._
	- _However, his life... Was cut short._
	- _One day, his experiments went wrong, and..._
	- _Well, I needn't gossip._
	- _After all, it's rude to talk about someone who's listening._
		- _Why is Striped Bird blocking [[Kris]] from the most interesting parts of the library In both Ch1 and Ch2?_ 
		- _And why is Striped Bird's name in the game files 'spr_normalnpc'?_
