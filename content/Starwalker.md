IN DELTARUNE Starwalker is a secret character, who be found in Ch1 in a room with a Starwalker Bird and a bell.

The Starwalker Bird is an enemy that appears to be a beak-shaped star with two large wings. When the bell is rung, it loses its wings and walks away. The Starwalker then appears in the same room.

The Starwalker looks like a yellow five point star with long legs. Interacting with him in the forest yields *"These birds are Pissing me off...  I'm the original    Starwalker"*. He subsequently appears several more times in Ch1 and Ch2, and even joins Lancer and Rouxls Caard inside Kris's inventory, though he can't be used and doesn't seem to have a corresponding Light World item.
- _Is Starwalker merely an easter egg character or is he going to have some role in the story? There are several unusual things regarding him:_
	- _He doesn't turn to stone in a foreign Dark World._
	- _He looks similar to the SAVE points from UNDERTALE._
	- _The room where the original Starwalker is encountered borders [[Man Behind the Tree|the hidden room with the tree]]._
	- _The wings of Starwalker Birds resemble ones on the Delta Rune._
	- _Though it is a stretch, the combination of a bird and a bell might allude to [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|"Wing Ding"]]_
