**IN DELTARUNE**, Warp Doors are special doors that can transport the party between various points within a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark World.md')">Dark World</a>. They start out as empty black doorframes and turn into red doors with multi-coloured flames dancing underneath upon activation. 

The very first activated door in Ch1 is fixed by several minor characters to help the Fun Gang travel around faster. Afterwards, doors are usually activated by simply reaching a location. 
In Ch2 on Weird Route the doors never activate.

**IN UNDERTALE**, the door to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\' Room')">Sans' Room</a> looks like a Warp Door. The significance of this is unknown.
