IN DELTARUNE there are a number of lines hidden in the game files, whose names start with *"unused"*. They are coming from someone trapped in a dark place.

**The messages in Ch1:**
*Where...
Where am I?
Hello...? Anyone...?
Is... is anybody out there...?
Someone!? Anyone!? Can anyone hear me!?
...
It's dark.
It's so dark here.
Someone, anyone, if you can hear me...
Say something... please...*

**The messages in Ch2:**
*No one can hear me, can they?
...
I guess not.
To be honest, I'm not even sure I can hear myself.
It's so quiet here...
... and yet, sometimes,
I swear I hear something...
Something like... scratching?*

Additionally, while talking with Spamton in his shop, asking him about "FEAR" yields:
"WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF??? ACCORDING TO [Encyclopedia of Being Afraid] THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR EXCEPT ... ... can anyone hear me? Help... HUH??? WHAT?? NO, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING JUST NOW!!! ... BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE TALKING TO YOU."

- _Is this the same person as in the messages above?_
	- _How are they communicating through Spamton?_
