**IN DELTARUNE**, there are a number of lines hidden in the game files, marked as *"unused"*. They are coming from someone trapped in a dark place.

**The messages in Ch1:**
Where...</br>
Where am I?</br>
Hello...? Anyone...?</br>
Is... is anybody out there...?</br>
Someone!? Anyone!? Can anyone hear me!?</br>
...</br>
It's dark.</br>
It's so dark here.</br>
Someone, anyone, if you can hear me...</br>
Say something... please...</br>

**The messages in Ch2:**
No one can hear me, can they?</br>
...</br>
I guess not.</br>
To be honest, I'm not even sure I can hear myself.</br>
It's so quiet here...</br>
... and yet, sometimes,</br>
I swear I hear something...</br>
Something like... scratching?</br>

Additionally, while talking with Spamton in his shop, asking him about "FEAR" yields:
"WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF??? ACCORDING TO [Encyclopedia of Being Afraid] THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR EXCEPT ... ... can anyone hear me? Help... HUH??? WHAT?? NO, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING JUST NOW!!! ... BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE TALKING TO YOU."

- _Is this the same person as in the messages above?_
	- _How are they communicating through Spamton?_
