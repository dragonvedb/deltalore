**IN DELTARUNE**, there are a number of lines hidden in the game files, marked as *"unused"*. They are coming from someone trapped in a dark place.

**The messages in Ch1:**
Where...</br>
Where am I?</br>
Hello...? Anyone...?</br>
Is... is anybody out there...?</br>
Someone!? Anyone!? Can anyone hear me!?</br>
...</br>
It's dark.</br>
It's so dark here.</br>
Someone, anyone, if you can hear me...</br>
Say something... please...</br>

**The messages in Ch2:**
No one can hear me, can they?</br>
...</br>
I guess not.</br>
To be honest, I'm not even sure I can hear myself.</br>
It's so quiet here...</br>
... and yet, sometimes,</br>
I swear I hear something...</br>
Something like... scratching?</br>

	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">The Vessel?</a>_
- _Where are they trapped?_
	- _Inside a Dark World?_
	- _In the <a onclick="loadFile('Bunker.md')">Bunker</a>?_
	- _Beyond time and space?_
- _Where is the scratching coming from?_

Additionally, while talking with <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> in his shop, asking him about "FEAR" yields:
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF??? ACCORDING TO [Encyclopedia of Being Afraid]
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR EXCEPT
... ... can anyone hear me? Help...
HUH??? WHAT?? NO, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING JUST NOW!!!
... BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE TALKING TO YOU."

- _This seems to be the same person as in the messages above, though it's unclear how they are speaking through Spamton._
