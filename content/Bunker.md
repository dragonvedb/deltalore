**IN DELTARUNE** the Bunker is a mysterious structure located in the woods on the Hometown's outskirts. The only visible part is a rusty locked double door, covered in vines.
- _Will the bunker host a [[Dark Worlds|Dark World]] in one of the future chapters?_
	- _Is it already a Dark World?_
- _Doesn't it seem like the vines are coming from behind the door?_

Near the Bunker background sounds fade away and all that can be heard is a low droning noise which is actually _[[mus_smile]]_ slowed down by 666% (number associated with [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Dr. Gaster]]). 
- _How is the Bunker connected to [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Dr. Gaster]]? Is he located underground?_

Snowy and Monster Kid appear near the Bunker in Ch2. From their dialogue we learn that Kris has been spreading rumors that something terrifying is behind the doors.
- _Did Kris ever go into the Bunker? Or witness something happening inside?_
	- _Could this be related to [[Dess Holiday|Dess's]] disappearance?_

Noelle mentions that she and Kris once explored the forest behind the graveyard - where the Bunker is located - but, strangely, says that they didn't find anything there.
