**IN UNDERTALE**, Sans's room is located on the second floor of skeleton brothers' house. The door is locked and strange colorful flames are bursting out from underneath it, similar to DELTARUNE"S <a onclick="loadFile('Warp Door.md')">Warp Door</a>. When interacting with the door, <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a> remarks that Sans' room is "like another world..."
- _This may be another hint that Sans originally comes from a different timeline._

To access the room, <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> has to prove to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> that they are a time traveler by learning his special password and repeating it back to him in the past. Sans then gives Frisk the key and says "it's time you learn the truth".
- _Why is Sans not surprised at (and even plans for) meeting a time traveler? Has he met one before?_
	- _Why does he want to show them 'the truth', whatever that means?_

Upon entering the room, it appears entirely black and seems to be much bigger on the inside. After Frisk moves through the darkness for some time, Papyrus comes in and turns on the lights, revealing that Frisk was actually walking on a treadmill, with a note attached to it that reads "the truth is that you got dunked pal..." Papyrus then asks "Is Sans pranking you across time and space?"

The fakeout is averted though, as the room contains the Silver Key, which opens the door to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\'s Workshop.md')">Sans's Workshop</a>.
- _The words 'time and space' appear several more times in UT and DR:_
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">W.D. Gaster</a> was 'scattered across time and space'._
	- _DELTARUNE's<a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> was 'foretold by time and space'._
