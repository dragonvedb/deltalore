IN UNDERTALE, Sans' room is located on the second floor of skeleton brothers' house. The door is locked and strange colorful flames are bursting out underneath it, similar to DELTARUNE"S <a onclick="loadFile('Warp Door.md')">Warp Door</a>. When interacting with the door, <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a> remarks that Sans' room is "like another world..."
- _Is the _

To access the room, Frisk has to prove to Sans that they are a time traveler by learning his special password and repeating it back to him in the past. Sans then gives Frisk the key and says "it's time you learn the truth".
- _Why is Sans not surprised at (and even plans for) meeting a time traveler? Has he met one before?_
- _Why does he allow time travelers into his room? Why does he want to give them 'the truth'. whatever that is?_

Upon entering the room, it appears entirely black and seems to be much bigger on the inside. After moving through the darkness for some time, Papyrus comes in and turns on the lights, revealing that Frisk was actually walking on a treadmill, with a note attached to it that reads "the truth is that you got dunked pal..." Papyrus then asks "Is Sans pranking you across time and space?"
The fake out is averted though, as the room contains the Silver Key, which opens the door to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans\'s Workshop.md')">Sans's Workshop</a>.
- _Does Sans room exist outside of normal space?_
- _Words 'time and space' appear several more times in UT and DR:_
	- <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">W.D. Gaster</a> was 'scattered across time and space'.
	- <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> was 'foretold by time and space'.
