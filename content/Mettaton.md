**IN UNDERTALE**, Mettaton is a robot celebrity with a cult following in the Underground. 

Mettaton was originally a ghost (Napstablook's cousin, possibly inititally called Hapstablook) with an interest in humans and human culture. He founded the Human Fanclub, where he met Alphys. She offered to create a robotic body for Mettaton that he could inhabit and control.

After becoming a robot, Mettaton launched his career in media and quickly became popular.

After Frisk fell into the Undergorund, Alphys asked Mettaton to pretent to be a human-hating kill robot, so that Alphys might pretend to 'save' Frisk from him, in order to win Frisk's trust and convince them to stay in the Underground. Mettaton initially agreed, but at the very end decided to actually kill Frisk, absorb their Soul, cross the barrier and become a superstar on the Surface. During this battle he transforms into a new advanced and human-like form called Mettaton EX.

In the Genocide route, Alphys builds a battle body for Mettaton called Mettaton NEO. However, this form has no attacks and always dies in one hit.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Mettaton doesn't appear directly, but he likely lives as a ghost together with Napstablook.

Spamton NEO's body was likely created by Mettaton via a painting program, imbuing it with special power and possibly creating a Shadow Crystal that Spamton later found.
