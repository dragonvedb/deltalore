IN DELTARUNE the Church is a large building at the center of Hometown's religious life. It is administered by [[Father Alvin]] and possibly also Ms. Boom, his relative. The Church has a choir that Asriel used to sing in. 

Not much is known about the religion, except that it worships the [[Angel]], doesn't have the concepts of confession and sin and uses Deltarune as its symbol.
- _How does the Legend of Deltarune fit into religion? When [[Ralsei]] talks about banishing the Angel's Heaven, does he mean the same Angel that is worshipped in the Church?_
	- _Is there eventually going to be conflict between the [[Prophecy]] and the Church's teachings?_

Beside the Church is a graveyard. [[Gerson Boom]] is buried there, as well as Crystal, Muttler and Shyra, who are likely references to UT's [[Amalgamates]].

_Given its connection to the Angel, Rudy planning to go there in Ch2 and the fact that it has double doors, the Church is a possible [[Dark World]] candidate_.
