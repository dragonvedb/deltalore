IN DELTARUNE the Church is a large building at the center of Hometown's religious life. It is administered by <a onclick="loadFile('Father Alvin.md')">Father Alvin</a> and possibly also Ms. Boom, his relative. The Church has a choir that Asriel used to sing in. 

Not much is known about the religion, except that it worships the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>, doesn't have the concepts of confession and sin and uses Deltarune as its symbol.
- _How does the Legend of Deltarune fit into religion? When <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> talks about banishing the Angel's Heaven, does he mean the same Angel that is worshipped in the Church?_
	- _Is there eventually going to be conflict between the <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> and the Church's teachings?_

Beside the Church is a graveyard. <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson Boom</a> is buried there, as well as Crystal, Muttler and Shyra, who are likely references to UT's <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a>.

_Given its connection to the Angel, Rudy planning to go there in Ch2 and the fact that it has double doors, the Church is a possible <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a> candidate_.
