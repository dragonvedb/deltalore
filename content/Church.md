**IN DELTARUNE**, the Church is a large building at the center of Hometown's religious life, crowned with the winged circle that comprises the top part of the Delta Rune. It is administered by <a onclick="loadFile('Father Alvin.md')">Father Alvin</a> and possibly also Ms. Boom, his relative. The Church has a choir that <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> used to sing in. 

Not much is known about the religion, except that it worships the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a> and doesn't have the concepts of confession or sin.
- _How does the Legend of Delta Rune fit into the religion?_
	- _When <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> talks about banishing the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel's</a> <a onclick="loadFile('Heaven.md')">Heaven</a>, does he mean the same Angel that is worshipped in the Church?_
	- _Is there a conflict between the <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> and the Church's teachings?_

Beside the Church is a graveyard. <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson Boom</a> is buried there, as well as Crystal, Muttler and Shyra, who are likely references to UT's <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a>.

In Ch2 <a onclick="loadFile('Rudy Holiday.md')">Rudy</a> says he is planning to go to Church tomorrow.
- _Since Ch3 takes place at night, 'tomorrow' likely means in Ch4._
	- _Considering that the Church has double-doors and is connected to the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel</a>, the Church might host the Ch4 <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>._
