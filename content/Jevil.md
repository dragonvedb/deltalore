**IN DELTARUNE**, Jevil is the secret boss of Ch1 and a <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Crystal.md')">Shadow Crystal</a> holder.

He used to be a jester in the royal court, until he met someone, who revealed to him that his world is simply a game. After he started talking about it, the Four Kings ordered <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a> to seal Jevil in the castle's basement.

Despite this, Jevil believes himself to be all-powerful and the only free person in the world.

With Seam's help, <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> can unlock Jevil's cell by finding and combining three hidden key pieces. They then fight Jevil in an arena that looks like a spinning carousel. 

One of Jevil's attacks has a small chance to involve a duck with the head of the <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>. The significance of this is unknown.

At the end of the fight, Jevil foretells the future.

If defeated peacefully, he says *"FROM NOW, A NIGHTMARE WILL AWAKEN IN YOUR HEARTS. IN THE SHADOW OF THE KNIGHT'S HAND..."* and gives Kris the Devilstail armour.

If defeated violently, he says *"THE HAND OF THE KNIGHT IS DRIFTING FORWARD. SOON, THE "QUEEN" RETURNS, AND HELL'S ROAR BUBBLES FROM THE DEPTHS..."* and transforms into the Devilsknife weapon.
