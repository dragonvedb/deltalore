**IN DELTARUNE**, Jevil is the secret boss of Ch1 and a <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Crystal.md')">Shadow Crystal</a> holder.

He used to be a jester in the royal court of the Card Kings, until he encountered a strange person who told Jevil something that drove him insane. According to <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam</a>, he "began to see the world as a game, and everyone as its participants."
The Four Kings then ordered Seam< to seal Jevil in the castle's basement.

Despite being imprisoned, Jevil considers himself to be the only free being in the world.
- _Assuming the 'strange someone' that Jevil met is the same person who called <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Spamton</a> on the phone, it is likely <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Dr. W. D. Gaster</a>._
    - _Seam says that their worldview became 'darker, yet darker' after listening to Jevil, which is a reference to <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Entry 17</a>._
- _What specifically did Jevil learn?_
    - _Possibly something related to the true nature of <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">the Dark Worlds</a> and/or <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a>._
    - _Since he specifically started seeing the world as a game, it might have made him aware of the 4th wall._
        - _At the start of the battle he offers Kris to play a game with the rule "If your HP reaches 0, you lose". This is a reference to UNDERTALE's start menu and one of the few mentions of HP in a non-tutorial context._
    -_Regardless of what it was, he seems to consider it liberating._

With <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam's</a> help, <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> can unlock Jevil's cell by finding and combining three hidden key pieces. They then fight Jevil in an arena that looks like a spinning carousel. 
- _One of Jevil's attacks has a small chance to involve a duck with the head of the <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>. The significance of this is unknown._

At the end of the fight, Jevils makes an ominous prediction.
If defeated peacefully, he says *"FROM NOW, A NIGHTMARE WILL AWAKEN IN YOUR HEARTS. IN THE SHADOW OF THE KNIGHT'S HAND..."* and gives Kris the Devilstail armour.
If defeated violently, he says *"THE HAND OF THE KNIGHT IS DRIFTING FORWARD. SOON, THE "QUEEN" RETURNS, AND HELL'S ROAR BUBBLES FROM THE DEPTHS..."* and transforms into the Devilsknife weapon.
- _Both predictions specifically focus on the Knight's hand. This trend continues in Ch2, where the hand is mentioned two more times and a picture of hand holding a knife is used as a stand-in for the Knight._
- _The second prediction has what is likely the earliest mention of <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a> and one of the very few references to <a onclick="loadFile('Depths.md')">the Depths</a>._
