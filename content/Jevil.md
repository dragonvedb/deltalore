IN DELTARUNE Jevil is the secret boss of Ch1 and a [[Shadow Crystal]] holder.

He used to be a jester in the royal court, until he met an unknown person, who revealed to him that the world is one giant game. After he started talking about it, the Four Kings ordered [[Seam]] to seal Jevil in the castle's basement.

Despite this, Jevil believes himself to be all-powerful and the only free person in the world.

With Seam's help, [[Kris]] can unlock Jevil's cell by finding and combining three hidden key pieces. They then fight Jevil in an arena that looks like a spinning carousel. 

One of Jevil's attacks has a small chance to involve a duck with the head of the [[Everyman]]. The significance of this is unknown.

At the end of the fight, Jevil foretells the future.
If defeated peacefully, he says *"FROM NOW, A NIGHTMARE WILL AWAKEN IN YOUR HEARTS. IN THE SHADOW OF THE KNIGHT'S HAND..."* and gives Kris the Devilstail armour.
If defeated violently, he says *"THE HAND OF THE KNIGHT IS DRIFTING FORWARD. SOON, THE "QUEEN" RETURNS, AND HELL'S ROAR BUBBLES FROM THE DEPTHS..."* and transforms into the Devilsknife weapon.
