**IN UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE**, Everyman is an enigmatic character with an unclear role in the story.

**IN UNDERTALE**, it appears as part of the <a onclick="loadFile('Reaper Bird.md')">Reaper Bird's</a> attacks. It either starts multiplying its own head and launching the copies at <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a>, or is attacked and tormented by butterflies, seemingly losing its head.

Its name in the game files is _strangeman_, but early after the game's release, Toby Fox posted the picture of this character on Twitter with the caption 'Everyman' and description "Just a good guy who shows up on occasion". This description was later reused in the Undertale Art Book.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Everyman continues to appear as part of enemy attacks. Its head can replace a duck's head in <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil's</a> carousel attack; it can appear on a window in a Poppup's attack; and it also has a chance to be one of the chatters in Queen's Drama attack, where it is the only one that doesn't emit any words.

Graffitos of Everyman can be found in the Hometown in both chapters. In Ch1, it appears next to a drawing of <a onclick="loadFile('ICE-E.md')">ICE-E</a>. In Ch2, it is located on the back wall of ICE-E pizza restaurant.
