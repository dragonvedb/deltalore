**IN DELTARUNE**, Dark Worlds are pocket dimensions that exist within the Light World (primary, ordinary, 'real' world). The inhabitants of Dark and Light worlds are called, respectively, Darkners and Lightners.

Dark Worlds can be created by any Lightner with sufficient amount of Determination by simply stabbing the ground with a sharp object, such as a knife or a pin. A black geyser, called a Dark Fountain, bursts out and fills the room with darkness. Lightners who enter the room fall into a Dark World. Exiting the Dark World is only possible by sealing its Fountain (with the exception of Castle Town).

Dark Worlds are themed around a space they were created in. Larger objects, like furniture, might become major locations. Smaller items turn into sentient Darkners.

From what has been seen so far, Darkners are usually organized into some kind of society, with one or several rulers at the top. Darkners are generally good-natured, but might attack Lightners if ordered to. 
According to <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a>, Darkners derive their self-worth from serving Lightners and become unhappy if they cannot fulfil this need.

Darkners are bound to their original Dark World and turn to stone if they spend too much time in a different one.

Dark Worlds and their denizens seem to have extensive histories, even if they were created recently. Moreover, Darkners can somehow be familiar with Darkners from other Dark Worlds, even if those Dark Worlds have not been created yet.

Opening Dark Fountains disrupts the balance of Light and Dark. If the balance shifts too far, <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a> will occur.

It is unknown what happens if one opens a fountain while already inside of a Dark World. Berdly almost attempts it, but Ralsei stops him by warning him about the Roaring.

As of Ch2, these four Dark Worlds are known (the names are unofficial):

**Closet World** is located in the school supply closet. It is unknown who created it and how long ago.
It consists mostly of barren cliffs submerged in an ocean of darkness, except for a small built-up area surrounding the castle. Notably, the town is named after the Player, using whatever name they provided during the Goner Maker sequence (e.g. "\[PLAYER]town").
- _The area with the cliffs is named '??????'. The meaning of this is unknown._
    - _Some cliffs there have eyes carved into them. These eyes can also be seen on the Titans said to emerge during <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>._

<a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> is the ruler of this world ("Prince of the Kingdom of Darkness"), as well as its only initial inhabitant
The fountain that gives form to Castle Town is made of pure darkness. This grants Ralsei immunity to petrification and also lets Darkners from any Dark World co-exist there without turning to stone. 
Over the course of the game, Castle Town fills up with characters recruited and saved from other Dark Worlds.

This world is also unique in that Lightners can leave it at any time without closing the Fountain.

**Card Kingdom** is located in the unused classroom, which is connected to the closet via a door. It was created by <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">the Knight</a> a short time before the start of Ch1 and is themed around board games (such as playing cards and chess) and toys.

THe Kingdom was ruled jointly by four Card Kings, but the Knight elevated one of them, the King of Spades, to absolute power and the other three Kings were imprisoned. The King is resentful towards Lightners for abandoning the Darkners (since the classroom has not been used for a while) and seeks revenge by covering the world in darkness, believing that Darkners will then come to rule the world.

**Cyber World** is located in the Libraby's computer lab. It was created by <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">the Knight</a> either in between Ch1 and Ch2, when the lab was empty or during Ch2, after <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a> and Berdly began studying there. This world is themed around computers, internet and video games.

Cyber World is ruled by a Queen (a laptop in the Light World), who wants to open more Dark Fountains to subjugate Lightners and then make them happy by fulfiling their deepest desires.

**TV World** is located in the living room of Dreemur household. It was created by <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> at the end of Ch2. This Dark World hasn't been seen yet, but is going to be themed around television shows and possibly some areas of the house as well.
