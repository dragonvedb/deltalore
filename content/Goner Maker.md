**IN DELTARUNE**, the Goner Maker sequence is the part of the game where the Player creates <a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">a Vessel</a>. Its name in the game code is DEVICE\_GONERMAKER.

The sequence is launched immediately after <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">the Red Soul</a> appears and <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Dr. Gaster</a> establishes connection with the Player. AUDIO\_ANOTHERHIM starts playing and IMAGE\_DEPTH appears in the background. Dr. Gaster informs the Player that the first thing they must do is create a Vessel.

The Player first constructs the Vessel's body choosing from several head, torso and leg options.

Then, Gaster tells the Player to "shape its mind" as their own.<br>
The Player selects the Vessels favourite food ('Sweet', 'Soft', 'Sour', 'Salty', 'Pain' or 'Cold');<br>
their favourite blood type ('A', 'AB', 'B', 'C' or 'D'; note that the last three types don't exist);<br>
its favourite colour ('Red', 'Blue', 'Green' or 'Cyan');<br>
and, finally, its gift ('Kindness', 'Mind', 'Ambition', 'Bravery' or 'Voice').

Gaster asks the Player how they feel about their creation, with the clarification that it will not hear the response. The Player can choose between 'Love', 'Hope', 'Disgust' and 'Fear'.

Then, Gaster asks whether the Player answered truthfully and whether they "acknowledge the possibility of pain and seizure". The meaning of these questions is unknown.

Finally, the Player gives <a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">the Vessel</a> a <a onclick="loadFile('Name Selector.md')">name</a>.

Further establishing the distinction between the Player and the Vessel, <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a> asks to provide the creator's name as well.

The Goner Maker sequence ends with a sudden interruption. The screen cuts to black and <a onclick="loadFile('Third Entity.md')">an unknown speaker</a> announces, that the Player's answers will be discarded.
- _The answers are actually saved in the game code, though, suggesting they might become relevant later._
- _It's unclear if the interruption was unplanned or still part of Gaster's script._
