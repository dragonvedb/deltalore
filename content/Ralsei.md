**IN DELTARUNE**, Ralsei is the self-proclaimed Prince of the Kingdom of Darkness and, presumably, one of the three heroes of the Prophecy.

Ralsei is the ruler of the Castle Town Dark World, located in the school's supply closet. Seemingly its only resident, Ralsei spent his entire life waiting for the other two heroes to arrive. After meeting Kris and Susie, he tells them about the Prophecy and implores them to accept their destiny.

Ralsei is committed to fulfiling the Prophecy and averting the Roaring. He dislikes violence and suggest that Kris spare enemies instead of fighting them. At the same time, he constantly emphasises Kris's freedom to decide on their own course of action and is extremely accomodating of their choices, even when he disagrees with or is hurt by them. He believes that serving Lightners is a Darkner's only purpose in life.

Out of all other characters, Ralsei shows the most fondness towards Kris. He blushes if Kris comes close to him, which is a unique interaction.
Kris, as shown via the Name Tea, seems to feel more neutral about Ralsei, but the Player can force them to feign affection on many occasions.

Ralsei's name is an anagram of Asriel, Kris's brother. The two look similar, though Ralsei's appearance and fur colour are concealed until the end of Ch1.
Ralsei is also the one who explains battle mechanics, which is the role Flowey played in UT, down to the same phrazing ("This is your SOUL, the very culmination of your being!").

Unlike other Darkners, Ralsei doesn't turn to stone when outside his original Dark World. He explains it as a consequence of Castle Town's Fountain being made of "pure darkness". He is also able to traverse between Dark Worlds on his own, even if their corresponding Light World locations are far apart. 

Ralsei seems to be the only Darkner, other than possibly Jevil and Spamton, who is aware that, in the absence of a Fountain, Darkners are simply inanimate objects in the Light World. This is demonstrated in Ch2, when he instructs Kris to collect everything from the unused classroom (Card Kingdom) and bring it to the supply closet (Castle Town).

He is also somehow able to shift Players focus towards Susie, whenever she is separated from the party, which he does once in both chapters. During this time, Ralsei seems to talk to Kris while the Player can't hear them (except for the last words, "so that's why").
On the Weird Route, the focus shift doesn't happen, which briefly makes Ralsei panic and fruitlessly ask Susie about what happened while he couldn't see her.
He also becomes confused in the aftermath of the Spamton NEO fight on the normal route, awkwardly trying to make Kris forget about it.

Considering Ralsei never mentions the Roaring until Ch2 -- and then only to stop Berdly from opening another Dark Fountain -- it is unclear how much more of the Prophecy he knows and chooses to keep secret.
