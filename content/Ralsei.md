**IN DELTARUNE**, Ralsei is the self-proclaimed Prince of the Kingdom of Darkness and, presumably, one of the three heroes of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a>.

Ralsei is the ruler of the Castle Town <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>, located in the school's supply closet. Seemingly its only resident, Ralsei spent his entire life waiting for the other two heroes to arrive. After meeting <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a>, he tells them about the Prophecy and implores them to accept their destiny.

Ralsei is committed to fulfiling the Prophecy and averting <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>. He dislikes violence and suggest that Kris spare enemies instead of fighting them. At the same time, he constantly emphasises Kris's freedom to decide on their own course of action and is extremely accomodating of their choices, even when he disagrees with or is hurt by them. He believes that serving Lightners should be Darkner's only purpose in life.

Ralsei shows the most fondness towards <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>. He blushes if Kris comes close to him, which is a unique interaction.
- _Kris, as demonstrated via the Name Tea, seems to feel more neutral about Ralsei, but the Player can force them to feign affection on many occasions._

Ralsei's name is an anagram of <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, Kris's brother. The two look similar, though Ralsei's face and fur colour are concealed until the end of Ch1.
- _Ralsei is also the one who explains battle mechanics, which is the role <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> played in UT -- down to nearly the same phrazing ("This is your <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">SOUL</a>, the very culmination of your being!")._
- _What is the connection between Ralsei and Asriel?_
    - _Ralsei might represent Kris's 'ideal self', being  more similar to their adopted family and specifically to Asriel._
        - _In this case, Ralsei's Light World object might be a headband with horns that Kris used to wear as a kid._
        - _Or it could be some item that used to belong to Asriel._
    - _Alternatively, Ralsei might not have a Light World counterpart at all, and instead be created deliberately to be appealing to Kris or the Player._

Unlike other Darkners, Ralsei doesn't turn to stone when outside his original <a onclick="loadFile('Dark World.md')">Dark World</a>. He explains it as a consequence of Castle Town's Fountain being made of "pure darkness". He is also able to traverse between Dark Worlds on his own, even if their corresponding Light World locations are far apart. 

Ralsei is aware that, in the absence of a Fountain, Darkners are simply inanimate objects in the Light World. This is demonstrated in Ch2, when he instructs <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> to collect everything from the unused classroom (Card Kingdom) and bring it to the supply closet (Castle Town).
- _Queen is also aware that her Dark World is located in the library, so this knowledge is not unique to Ralsei. It's unlear if all Darkners possess it or not._

Ralsei is also somehow able to shift Players focus towards <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a>, whenever she is separated from the party. During this time, Ralsei seems to talk to Kris while the Player can't hear them (except for the last words, "so that's why").
On the Weird Route, the focus shift doesn't happen, which briefly makes Ralsei panic and fruitlessly ask Susie about what happened while he couldn't see her.
He is also confused in the aftermath of the <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton NEO</a> fight on the normal route, awkwardly trying to make Kris forget about it.
