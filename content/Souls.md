**IN UNDERTALE**, souls are objects described by Flowey as "the very culmination of \[one's\] being". 

Both humans and monsters possess souls, though of distinct kinds:

Humans' souls can be of various colors and possess unique traits, as demonstrated by the souls of the Six Humans. They have a lot of innate power, which allows them to persist after their bearer dies, seemingly indefinitely (it's unclear whether any special treatment is required to prevent them from shattering). Souls also seem to preserve some measure of free will and original personality of their owner.

Monsters' souls are white and shatter as soon as the monster dies, with the exception of Boss Monsters (such as Asgore, Toriel and Asriel), whose souls can persist for a short while. Monsters' souls are much weaker compared to human souls, with the souls of all the monsters in the Underground about equal in power to one human soul. However, monsters are much more attuned to their souls, which allows them to express themselves freely through magic.
- _Note that humans are also capable of wielding magic, which they used to create the Barrier. How exactly they do it is unclear._ 

Nobody knows for certain what souls are made of, but monsters believe that souls are composed of love, hope and compassion. This is used to explain why monsters' attacks become weaker or stronger depending on theirs and their opponent's killing intent.

Both humans and monsters can absorb each other's souls. A monster with a human's soul becomes incredibly powerful and their strength grows exponentially with each soul absorbed. The power of seven human souls is enough to become godlike. The fear of monsters empowering themselves via human souls is what led to the war that ended with monsters imprisoned Underground.
The power of seven human souls in required to break the Barrier, and the power of one human and at least one monster soul is required to exit through it.

Some sentient creatures can live without a soul. Examples include Flowey and possibly Chara. According to Flowey, without a soul he cannot feel any empathy or compassion for others.
It is unknown if ordinary humans and monsters can survive without a soul.

Determination seems to be a different property to soul power, but still emanating from them (though Flowey and possibly Chara still have Determination despite lacking a soul).

Alphys used the D.T. Extractor in the True Lab to extract Determination from the six human souls and tried to inject it into dying monsters to preserve their souls after death, and thus eventually collect enough to break the barrier. The experiment failed, as the monsters turned into Amalgamates.

**IN DELTARUNE**, the only soul mentioned is the Red Soul, which resides inside Kris and partially controls their actions. It is also described as "the very culmination of \[one's\] being", now by Ralsei, but it's unclear if other humans, monsters or Darkners have souls.

Kris is able to rip the Red Soul out of their body. It is commonly believed that, even though Kris can survive without the soul, they have difficulty moving. However, it is worth noting that at the end of Ch1, Kris has a shambling gate even before they remove the soul.

Spamton wants to acquire Kris's soul, believing that it will let him ascend to Heaven.
