**IN UNDERTALE**, souls are objects described by <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> as "the very culmination of \[one's\] being". 

Both humans and monsters possess souls, though of distinct kinds:

Humans' souls can be of various colors and possess unique traits, as demonstrated by the souls of the <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">Six Humans</a>. They have a lot of innate power, which allows them to persist after their bearer dies, seemingly indefinitely (it's unclear whether any special treatment is required to prevent them from shattering). Souls also seem to preserve some measure of free will and original personality of their owner.

Monsters' souls are white and shatter as soon as the monster dies, with the exception of Boss Monsters (such as <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>), whose souls can persist for a short while. Monsters' souls are much weaker compared to human souls, with the souls of all the monsters in the Underground about equal in power to one human soul. However, monsters are much more attuned to their souls, which allows them to express themselves freely through magic.
- _Note that humans are also capable of wielding magic, which they used to create the Barrier. How exactly they do it is unclear._ 

Nobody knows for certain what souls are made of, but monsters believe that souls are composed of love, hope and compassion. This is used to explain why monsters' attacks become weaker or stronger depending on theirs and their opponent's killing intent.

Both humans and monsters can absorb each other's souls. A monster with a human's soul becomes incredibly powerful and their strength grows exponentially with each soul absorbed. The power of seven human souls is enough to become godlike. The fear of monsters empowering themselves via human souls is what led to the war that ended with monsters imprisoned Underground.
The power of seven human souls in required to break the Barrier, and the power of one human and at least one monster soul is required to exit through it.

Some sentient creatures can live without a soul. Examples include <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> and possibly <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a>. According to Flowey, without a soul he cannot feel any empathy or compassion for others.
It is unknown if ordinary humans and monsters can survive without a soul.

<a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> seems to be a different property to soul power, but still emanating from souls (though Flowey and possibly Chara still have Determination despite lacking a soul).

<a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> used the D.T. Extractor in the <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">True Lab</a> to extract Determination from the <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">six human souls</a> and tried to inject it into dying monsters to preserve their souls after death, and thus eventually collect enough to break the barrier. The experiment failed, as the monsters turned into <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a>.

**IN DELTARUNE**, the only soul mentioned is the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Souls.md')">Red Soul</a>, which resides inside <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and allows the Player to control their actions. It is also described as "the very culmination of \[one's\] being", now by <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a>, but it's unclear if other humans, monsters or Darkners have souls.

The Red Soul is the only known object with the ability to close <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark Fountains</a>.

Kris is able to remove the Red Soul out of their body. It seems that without a soul they have difficulty moving, but are otherwise able to function.

<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> wants to acquire Kris's soul, believing that it will let him ascend to <a onclick="loadFile('Heaven.md')">Heaven</a>.
