**IN DELTARUNE**, the Red Soul is an object that allows the Player to control Kris. It is described by Ralsei as "the culmination of you being", holding "will", "compassion" and "the fate of the world".

The Red Soul first appears at the start of the Survey Program, after Gaster asks "ARE WE CONNECTED?". He then transitions to the Goner Maker sequence, where the Player creates a Vessel to house the Red Soul.

However, the process is interrupted by an unknown speaker and the Soul ends up inside Kris. 

The Soul allows the Player move Kris around, and issue battle orders through them. Kris retains some limited control over their movements, facial expressions and tone of voice; otherwise, they are beholden to Player's commands.

The Soul is the only thing that can seal Dark Fountains. This makes it essential for the fulfillment of the Prophecy.

Kris can remove the Soul from their body, seemingly at any time (though perhaps not inside Dark Worlds). The Player can still move the Soul once it has been removed, but cannot control or observe Kris.
- _Despite seeming to dislike being controlled, Kris always eventually puts the Soul back in._
    - _It's possible that they need the Soul to live. Their shambling gait when soulless is often considered as evidence for this, though it's worth noting that in Ch1 they shamble even before removing the Soul._
    - _Alternatively, they might understand that the Soul is necessary to fulfill the Prophecy and save the world._
    - _If the rules from UNDERTALE still hold, Kris might not be able t0 feel love without a Soul._

Ralsei can occasionally force the Red Soul to switch its focus towards Susie when she is separated from the party.

Whenever this switch happens, the Players has the illusion of controlling Susie, but, unlike Kris, she ignores all of the Soul's commands.

Noelle, by contrast, feels compelled to follow the Red Soul's orders even agaisnt her own will, as shown in the Weird Route. By the end of it, she can hear the Soul's voice as distinct from Kris's.

Spamton is obsessed with the Red Soul, believing it to be necessary for his ascension to Heaven.
