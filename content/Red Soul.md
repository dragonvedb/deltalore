**IN DELTARUNE**, the Red Soul is an object that allows the Player to control Kris. It is described by Ralsei as "the culination of you being", holding "will", "compassion" and "the fate of the world".

The Red Soul first appears at the start of the Survey Program, after Gaster asks "ARE WE CONNECTED?". He then says "EXCELLENT. NOW WE MAY BEGIN." and then transitions to the Goner Maker sequence, where the Player creates a Vessel for themselves.

However, the process is interrupted by an unknown speaker and the Soul ends up inside Kris. 

The Soul lets the Player move Kris around, and issue battle orders through them. Kris retains some limited control over their movements, facial expressions and tone of voice; otherwise, they are beholden to Player's commands.

The Soul is the only thing that can seal Dark Fountains. This makes it an essential part of the Prophecy.

Kris can rip the Soul out at any time. The Player can still move the Soul, but cannot control or observe Kris.
Despite seemingly disliking being controlled, Kris always eventually puts the Soul back in.

Ralsei can occasionally force the Red Soul to switch its focus towards Susie when she is separated from the party.
Whenever this switch happens, the Players has the illusion of controlling Susie, but, unlike Kris, she ignores the Soul's commands.

Noelle, by contrast, feels compelled to follow the Red Soul's orders even agaisnt her own will, as shown in the Weird Route. By the end, she can hear the Soul's voice as distinct from Kris's.

Spamton is obsessed with the Red Soul. He believes it to be necessary for his ascension to Heaven.
