**IN UNDERTALE**, the "Angel who has seen the surface" is a part of the Prophecy. 

Supposedly, one day the Angel will descend and either free or exterminate Monsterkind.
- _There are several characters, who could be considered the Angel:_
    - _Asriel sees the surface, dies, is reborn and then breaks the Barrier and frees monsters, fulfiling the prophecy._
        - _His final form has large wings._
    - _Chara comes from the surface, dies, is reborn and then annihilates the world, fulfiling the prophecy._
    - _Frisk comes from the surface and can be considered the ultimate cause of either freeing or destroying monsters, depending on the route._
        - _On repeated neutral route, Asgore states that he considers Frisk to be the Angel._
    - _The Player themselves could be the Angel, since they are the ones who control Frisk._
    - _Note that all four options are also candidates for being the Anomaly._

**IN DELTARUNE**, the Angel is the central figure of Hometown's religion. Little is known about it, but it is associated with light ("Let the Angel's power light your way") and observation ("May the Angel watch over you", "An angel is watching us").

Noelle and Dess made an angel doll in Church youth group. Kris and Asriel worked on one as well, but spent the entire time making large wings for it.
- _Noelle has many other connections to the Angel._
    - _As kids, Noelle and Dess would make snow angels in winter. Dess would then make Noelle's wings bigger._
    - _Noelle fantacizes about growing huge angel wings and flying above the Dark World._
    - _Spamton exclaims "\[Angel], \[Angel]" when Kris and Noelle visit him._
        - _Spamton himself has angelic connotations. His NEO body (which he prayed to before possessing it) has large wings and summons tiny angelic copies of himself._
    - _The Addison selling the Freeze Ring adresses Noelle as "angel"._
- _The final boss of Asriel's unfinished video game also has a large wings. This is likely a reference to Asriel's final form in UT._

The Legend of Delta Rune says that the three heroes will "banish Angel's Heaven". The meaning of this is unknown.
