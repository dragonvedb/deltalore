**IN UNDERTALE**, the "Angel who has seen the surface" is a part of the ancient <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Prophecy</a>. 

Accroding to this Prophecy, one day the Angel will descend from the world above and either free or exterminate Monsterkind.
- _There are several characters, who could be considered the Angel:_
    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> sees the surface, dies, is reborn and then breaks the Barrier and frees monsters, fulfiling the prophecy._
        - _His final form has large wings and is names 'God of Hyperdeath'._
        - _Asriel's name is similar to 'Azrael', an Angel of Death in Islam._
    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Chara.md')">Chara</a> comes from the surface, dies, is reborn and then annihilates the world, fulfiling the prophecy._
    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> comes from the surface and can be considered the ultimate cause of either freeing or destroying monsters, depending on the route._
        - _On repeated neutral route, <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> states that he considers Frisk to be the Angel._
    - _The Player themselves could be the Angel, since they are the ones who control Frisk._
    - _Note that all four are also candidates for being the <a onclick="loadFile('Anomaly.md')">Anomaly</a>._

**IN DELTARUNE**, the Angel is the central figure of Hometown's religion. Little is known about it, but it is associated with light ("Let the Angel's power light your way") and observation ("May the Angel watch over you", "An angel is watching us").
- _Clover has cut dialogue indicating that Darkners are also aware of Angel worship (but only one of her heads seems to believe in the Angel)._

The Legend of Delta Rune says that the three heroes will "banish Angel's <a onclick="loadFile('Heaven.md')">Heaven"</a>. The meaning of this is unknown.

<a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Dess.md')">Dess</a> made an angel doll in <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a> youth group. <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> worked on one as well, but spent the entire time making large wings for it.
The angel doll is described as white, faceless and unsettling.

- _<a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a> has multiple connections to the Angel._
    - _As kids, Noelle and Dess would compete to see who can make the biggest snow angel. Dess would then help make Noelle's wings bigger._
    - _Noelle fantacizes about growing huge angel wings and flying above the <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>._
    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> exclaims "\[Angel], \[Angel]" when <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> and Noelle visit him._
        - _Spamton himself has angelic connotations. His NEO body (which he prayed to before possessing it) has large wings and summons tiny angelic copies of himself._
    - _The Addison selling the Freeze Ring adresses Noelle as "angel"._
    - _Catti says "she is the light" when asked about Noelle._
    - _Noelle is also said to possess special powers that other Lightners don't have._

- _The Player could be the Angel._
    - _They are a being outside DELTARUNE's reality, looking at it from above and interfering with it._
    - _<a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">The Red Soul</a>, through which the Player puppets <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>, is repeatedly associated with light._
    - _There are several depictions of the Soul with wings._
    - _When Kris tears out their Soul at the end of Ch1, they are standing in such a way that the Soul overlaps with the Angel symbol of the Delta Rune printed on the carpet._
    - _If the Player is the Angel, would "banishing" mean disconnecting them from the game?_
