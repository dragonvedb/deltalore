**IN UNDERTALE**, Nightmare Mode is a <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Event</a> that triggers at values 56-57. It causes an image of a weird-looking snowman labeled as "Nightmare" to appear on the Monster Kidz Word Search, in addition to <a onclick="loadFile('ICE-E.md')">ICE-E</a>.

The meaning of this event is unknown. It is worth noting that while the word search puzzle given by <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> is the only mention of ICE-E in UT, in DELTARUNE he is a very popular mascot, who is also repeatedly mentioned as terrifying.
