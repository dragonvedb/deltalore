**IN UNDERTALE**, Alphys is the Royal Scientist working and living in the Hotland Lab.

She created a robot body for Mettaton after meeting him at his Human Fanclub. The idea of a robot with a Soul impressed Asgore so much, that he appointed Alphys as the new Royal Scientist in place of the missing Dr. Gaster.

Alphys was tasked with finding a way to break the Barrier without waiting for another human to fall. She came up with the idea of extracting the Determination from six aready collected human souls and injecting it into "fallen down" monsters shortly before they die. She hoped this would make it possible to collect and store the souls of dead monsters, until their combined power would be enough to free monsters.
Instead, the monsters inititally got better and then started melting together from excessive Determination, turning into Amalgamates. 

Alphys didn't tell anyone the truth about what happened to the fallen down monsters, despite demands from relatives. Wracked with guilt, she gradually became more and more reclusive.

In the course of her experiments, Alphys injected Determination into a golden flower taken from Agore's garden. Unbeknownst to her, the flower contained the essence of Asriel and came to life with his memories and personality, but unable to feel compassion due to lacking a Soul. He soon escaped from the Lab.

After Frisk falls into the Underground, Alphys tracks them via hidden cameras. She becomes so invested into their journey that she starts rooting for them. She even convinces Mettaton to pretend to hunt Kris throughout Hotland, so that Alphys can "save" Frisk from him and become the hero of the story.

At some point, Alphys met Undyne in the Waterfall dump and fell in love with her. 
In the True Pacifist route, Frisk helps Alphys confess her feelings, and the two become a couple.

In the Genocide route, Alphys takes charge and evacuates surviving monsters to the Lab's basement.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Alphys is a school teacher in Kris's and Susie's class, replacing the late Gerson Boom.

She is nervous, nerdy and a huge fan of anime, just like in UT.

In contrast to UNDERTALE, Alphys and Undyne don't know each other at the start of Ch1. However, in Ch2 Alphys crashes her bike due to being enraptured with Undyne. Undyne then asks Kris to hand Alphys a box of heart-shaped chocolates.

Alphys is on good terms with both Toriel and Asgore, who sometimes ask her about how Kris is doing at school.
