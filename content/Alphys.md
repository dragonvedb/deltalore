**IN UNDERTALE**, Alphys is a scientist and inventor working in the <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">Hotland Lab</a>.

She created a robot body for <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a> after meeting him at his Human Fanclub. The idea of a robot with a <a onclick="loadFile('Soul.md')">Soul</a> impressed <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> so much that he appointed Alphys as the new Royal Scientist in place of the missing <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Dr. Gaster</a>.

Alphys was tasked with finding a way to free monsters without waiting for another human to fall. She came up with the idea of extracting the <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> from <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">six aready collected human souls</a> and injecting it into "fallen down" monsters shortly before they die. She hoped this would make it possible to collect and store the souls of dead monsters, until their combined power would be enough to break the Barrier.
Instead, the monsters inititally seemed to get better and then started melting together from excessive Determination, turning into <a onclick="loadFile('Amalgamates.md')">Amalgamates</a>. 

Alphys didn't tell anyone the truth about what happened to the fallen down monsters, despite demands from relatives. Wracked with guilt, she gradually became more and more reclusive.

In the course of her experiments, Alphys injected <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> into a golden flower that grew in Asgore's garden. Unbeknownst to her, <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">the flower</a> contained the essence of <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a> and came to life with Asriel's memories and personality, but unable to feel compassion due to lacking a <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Soul</a>.

After <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> falls into the Underground, Alphys tracks them via hidden cameras. She becomes so invested into their journey that she starts rooting for them. She even convinces <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a> to pretend to hunt Frisk throughout Hotland, so that Alphys can "save" Frisk from him and become the hero of their story.

At some point, Alphys met <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a> in the Waterfall dump and fell in love with her. 
In the True Pacifist route, <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> helps Alphys confess her feelings to Undyne, and the two become a couple.

In the Genocide route, Alphys takes charge and evacuates surviving monsters to the <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">Lab's basement</a>.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Alphys is a school teacher in <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris's</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie's</a> class, replacing the late <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson Boom.md')">Gerson Boom</a>.

She is nervous, nerdy and a huge fan of anime, just like in UT.

In contrast to UNDERTALE, Alphys and <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a> don't know each other at the start of Ch1. However, in Ch2 Alphys crashes her bike due to being enraptured with Undyne. Undyne then asks Kris to hand Alphys a box of heart-shaped chocolates.

Alphys is on good terms with both <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>, who sometimes ask her about how Kris is doing at school.
