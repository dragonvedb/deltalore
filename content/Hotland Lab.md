**IN UNDERTALE**, the Hotland Lab is the scientific facility where Dr. Alphys, the current Royal Scientist, works and lives.

The above-ground part of the building includes Alphys's living quarters, workbench and computer desk. It also has a large screen connected to multiple cameras all over the Underground, which Alphys uses to observe Frisk.

The underground portion, known as True Lab, is far larger. This is where Alphys conducted research into ways to break the Barrier. This research is documented in the Lab Entries 1-21 that can be found on screens inside the Lab (with the exception of the missing Entry 17).

The DT Extraction Machine was used to extract Determination from the six human souls in Asgore's possession.
- _Alphys's log entries say she extracted the Determination "using the blueprints". This seems to imply she was not the one who designed the machine._
    - _Was it designed by Dr. Gaster?_

Determination was then injected into the bodies of fallen down monsters, who were likely quartered in the large bedroom. After some time, the monsters turned into Amalgamates.
Alphys continues to feed and care for Amalgamates in secret, because she is too afraid to reveal the truth to their relatives.

One of the rooms contains a VHS player and a few tapes that Alphys found in Asgore's castle while looking for information on humans. 
The first tape is a recording of a night-time conversation between Asgore and pregnant Toriel.
Four others were filmed by Asriel (with the lens cap on) and reveal the real story behind Asriel's and Chara's plan.

There is a room with several refridgerators inside. Before the ventilation is turned on, it is filled with dense fog.; inspecting the fridges yields strange, seemingly unrelated responses (the only fridge that is described normally later transforms into Snowdrake's Mother).
- _One of the fridges is described as 'a tree, ripe with delicious fruit'; another as 'something in the shape of a man'. This might foreshadow DELTARUNE's Man Behind the Tree._
- _One of the Fun Events is a misplaced call by Sans asking if the fridge is working. This might be another hint thats Sans used to work at the Lab._
