IN UNDERTALE the Fun Value is a hidden variable that is set to random number between 1 and 100 after every reset. Various anomalous events and characters may appear depending on this value, many of which (and possibly all of them) are connected in one way or another to [[Doctor W. D. Gaster]].

---
The first three of the 'fun' events involve [[Misplaced Calls|misplaced phone calls]]. 
- 2-39 - [[Misplaced Calls|Wrong Number Song]]
- 40-45 - [[Misplaced Calls|Sans's Call]]
- 46-50 - [[Misplaced Calls|Alphys's Call]]

---
Next is a bizarre event connected to [[ICE-E]].

- 56-57 - [[Nightmare Mode]]

---
The next five events all directly reference [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|W. D. Gaster]] and are triggered on values starting with '6', which is associated with him. They are also the rarest, with probabilities of 1% or below.

- 61 *(20% chance)* - [[Gaster Followers|Gaster's Follower 2]]
- 62 *(50% chance)* - [[Gaster Followers|Gaster's Follower 1]]
- 63 *(50% chance)* - [[Gaster Followers|Gaster's Follower 3]] 
- 65 (*50% chance)* - [[Sound Test]]
- 66 *(10% chance for Mystery Man room)* - [[Mystery Man|Fake Hallway]]

---
The last two events feature 'goners', a term with unclear meaning. 
In UNDERTALE, it is also used by [[Alphys]] in reference to monsters on the verge of death (who would later become [[Amalgamates]]); while DELTARUNE starts with the [[Goner Maker|Goner Maker sequence]].

- 80-89 *(81 for Goner Clam Girl)* - [[Clam Girl]]
- 90-100 - Goner Kid
