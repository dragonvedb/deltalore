IN DELTARUNE, the Knight is an enigmatic character who opened Dark Fountains in the unused classroom and in the computer lab.

The rulers of both Dark Worlds revere the Knight and wish to carry out their will, though they don't actually know much about them. 
The King was elevated to power by the Knight and believes that opening the fountains will let Darkners rule over Lightners. 
The Queen believes fountains will create a paradise where Lightners will be eternally happy. She wants <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> to take the Knight's place and create more fountains.

The Queen repeatedly refers to the Knight as "the Roaring Knight", even though she does not know about <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>. It's unknown where she got this name from.

Both Jevil and Spamton mention the Knight. Spamton attempts to explain how the Knight relates to communion, but is seemingly prevented by some outside power.
