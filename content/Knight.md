**IN DELTARUNE**, the Knight is an enigmatic character who opened Dark Fountains in the unused classroom and in the computer lab.

The rulers of both Dark Worlds revere the Knight and wish to carry out their will, though they don't actually know much about them.

The King was elevated to power by the Knight and believes that opening the fountains will let Darkners rule over Lightners.

The Queen believes fountains will create a paradise where Lightners will be eternally happy. She wants <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle Holiday.md')">Noelle</a> to take the Knight's place and cover the world in darkness.

The Queen repeatedly refers to the Knight as "the Roaring Knight", even though she does not know about <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>. It's unknown where she got this name from.

Both Jevil and Spamton mention the Knight. Spamton attempts to explain how the Knight relates to <a onclick="loadFile('Religious Connotations.md')">communion</a>, but is seemingly prevented by some outside power.

- _The Knight is repeatedly associated with the concept of a hand ("The hand of the Knight if drifting forward", "In the shadow of the Knight's hand", "Reaching Its Long Hand To The Sky"). In Ch2, Queen uses the image of a hand gripping a knife to symbolize the Knight._

- _Who is the Knight?_
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>?_
		- _They are seen creating a fountain after removing the Red Soul._
			- _They also removed the Soul the night between Ch1 and Ch2. It is unknown what exactly they did during this time, but they might have created the Computer Lab fountain and plugged in the TV in preparation for Ch3._
		- _They are shown to be somewhat troubled and lonely, which might be a motivator._
		- _They might not have been 'meant' to be controlled by the Player (the Vessel was) and only ended up as the hero of the story by chance._
		- _They own a knife and carry it seemingly at all times._
		- _They already have a save file at the start of the game, which the Player saves over; though the meaning of this is unclear, it might imply that Kris used a save point in the Dark Worlds before._
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Father Alvin.md')">Father Alvin</a>?_
		- _He is a priest worshipping the Angel, which is portrayed by the Prophecy as an antagonistic force connected to the Roaring._
		- _He mourns his late father, Gerson Boom, and praises his ability to create stories that "blossom into such a \[...] world-changing thing". Making of Dark Worlds might be interpreted as a kind of creative effort; Alvin might be trying to live up to his father's legacy._
		- _He is heard mumbling "... were you proud of me, father...? And... is it right for this hammer to..." by his father's grave. Though until now every object mentioned in relation with Dark Fountain creation has been sharp, there is no explicit confirmation that something like a hammer cannot be used to do it._
		- _Spamton's mention of communion could be another hint._
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>?_
		- _He is strangely absent from the first two chapters and attention is drawn to this fact._
		- _He is mentioned to be very lonely. Creating Dark Worlds could be a form of escapism, a creative outlet and/or an attempt to make friends._
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a>?_
		- _Since he is the one connecting the Player to the world of DELTARUNE (and possibly the author of the Prophecy), he could also be the one creating Dark Worlds for the Player to explore._
		- _Entry 17 sounds like it could be describing the creation of a Dark World._
		- _He might have a connectin with hands through the River Persons line ("Beware of the man who speaks in hands.")_
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Dess.md')">Dess</a>?_
		- _She has disappeared under unknown circumstances. If the Messages in the Code are indeed left by her, she might be trapped in some out-of-bounds place, like the Bunker or the Depths. Creation of Dark Worlds might be her attempts to break out._
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Ms. Holiday.md')">Noelle's mother, the Mayor?</a>_
		- _She has not been seen so far, being described as 'busy'. She is portrayed as cold, pragmatic and possibly a strong fighter._
		- _If Dess is indeed located in the Dark World (or the Depths), the Mayor could be searching for her in the Dark Worlds, or trying to cause the Roaring to bring her back._
	- _<a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">The Vessel</a>?_
		- _It could either be acting in service to the Player, in-line with its original purpose, by providing content for them in the form of Dark Worlds; or antagonistically, i.e. by seeking revenge for being discarded._
- _If the goal of the Roaring KNight is to cause the Roaring, why don't they open more then one Dark Fountain at a time?_
	- _It's unclear what the requirements for making a fountain are, and what exactly triggers the Roaring, so this might be a moot question._
- _Note that <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> never mentions the Knight directly and never states that stopping it is the goal of the party._
