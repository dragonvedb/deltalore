**IN DELTARUNE**, Seam is Darkner based on an old stuffed toy. In Ch1 they run a shop in the Card Kingdom, but relocate to Castle Town afterwards.

Before the Knight's arrival, Seam used to be a court magician and <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil's</a> acquaintance. They were also the one to lock Jevil in prison after he went insane.

Seam is kind, but extremely nihilistic, believing that the end of the world is coming soon and that nothing can be done to avert it. They claim to have became this way after speaking with Jevil. They use the phrase "my view of this world became darker, yet darker", which is a reference to <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a>.

Seam holds a lot of knowledge about the Dark Worlds and often makes predictions about the future as well. If they notice Kris holding a <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Crystal.md')">Shadow Crystal</a>, they ask to bring any Crystals they find to the shop, so that Seam can *"stitch together something incredible"*.

After Kris gets two Shadow Crystals, Seam says that the next Secret Boss might be impossible to defeat without something called a <a onclick="loadFile('Shadow Mantle.md')">Shadow Mantle</a>. They want to give it to Kris, but find that it has disappeared from their shop.

Seam's rotating button-eye looks identical to the face <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> makes when he says *"...monsters, humans, **everyone**..."* The significance of this is unclear.
