IN UNDERTALE ICE-E is mentioned once it the form of branding on a word search puzzle that Sans gives to Frisk. 
This would be unremarkable, if not for the fact that one of the Fun Events modifies the puzzle sheet, adding a picture of a deformed snowman with the word "Nightmare" underneath.

IN DELTARUNE ICE-E is popular mascot of a pizza restaurant named "ICE-E's P"e"zza". He appears as branding on various products, magazines, and even a graffito (next to a drawing of <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>) including in the Dark World.

There are multiple references to ICE-E being scary and 'real' in some way. Kris told Noelle that ICE-E eats kids when they were both little. Noelle later searched online whether ICE-E is a cryptid. One of the Spamton Sweepstakes webpages is Noelle's report on a site that documents ICE-E sightings. She saw his face wink at her from a pizza box. Dess tried to burn the box and they, together with Kris and Asriel, buried it in the graveyard.
