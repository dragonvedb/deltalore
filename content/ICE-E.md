**IN UNDERTALE**, ICE-E is mentioned once in the form of branding on a word search puzzle that Sans gives to Frisk. 

One of the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Events</a> modifies the puzzle sheet, adding a picture of a deformed snowman with the word "Nightmare" underneath.

**IN DELTARUNE**, ICE-E is a popular mascot of a pizza restaurant named "ICE-E's P"e"zza". He appears as branding on various products, magazines, and even a graffito (next to a drawing of <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>) including in the Dark World.

There are multiple references to ICE-E being scary and 'real' in some way. 

<a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> told <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a> that ICE-E eats kids when they were both little. 

Noelle later searched online whether ICE-E is a cryptid. One of the Spamton Sweepstakes webpages is Noelle's report on a site that documents ICE-E sightings. She saw his face wink at her from a pizza box. Dess tried to burn the box and they, together with Kris and <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, buried it in the graveyard.
