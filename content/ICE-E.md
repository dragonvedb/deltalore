**IN UNDERTALE**, ICE-E is mentioned once in the form of branding on a word search puzzle that <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> gives to <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a>. 

One of the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Events</a> changes the puzzle sheet, adding a picture of a deformed snowman with the word <a onclick="loadFile('Nightmare Mode.md')">"Nightmare"</a> underneath. The meaning of this is unknown.

**IN DELTARUNE**, ICE-E is a popular mascot of a pizza restaurant named "ICE-E's P"e"zza". He appears as branding on various products, magazines, and even a graffito (next to a drawing of <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>). In Ch2 one of the word puzzles features ICE-E, referencing UT.

There are multiple references to ICE-E being scary and 'real' in some way. 
<a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> told <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a> that ICE-E eats kids when they were both little. 
One of the Spamton Sweepstakes pages is Noelle's report on a website that documents ICE-E sightings. She saw his face wink at her from a pizza box. <a onclick="loadFile('Dess Holiday.md')">Dess</a> tried to burn the box and they, together with Kris and <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, buried it in the graveyard.
Noelle later searched online whether ICE-E is a cryptid.

- _The fact that ICE-E appears only in connection to <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> in UT, but is prominent in DR, adds fuel to theories that UNDERTALE's Sans is somehow connected to the world of DELTARUNE._
