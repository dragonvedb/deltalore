IN UNDERTALE, Sound Test is a room that has a 50% chance to appear after the battle with Papyrus if the Fun Value equals 65. It can also be accessed from the [[Redacted]] room, though the significance of this is unknown.

In this room the Player can listen to four unused music tracks: "Happy Town", "Meat Factory", "Trouble Dingle" and finally "[[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Gaster's]] Theme" (called *mus_st_him* in the game files). 

The first three are simple looping tracks a few seconds long. 

"Gaster's Theme" is a longer track that cannot be stopped once started. After some time the words "Thanks for your feedback! Be seeing you soon!" appear on the screen and Frisk is thrown out of the room.
- _Does Gaster's Theme feature in other tracks as a leitmotif?_
- _Will other tracks besides Gaster's Theme have any significance?_
- _Is there a connection between the line about 'feedback' and the [[Survey Program]]?_
