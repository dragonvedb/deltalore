**IN UNDERTALE**, Sound Test is a room that has a 50% chance to appear after the battle with Papyrus if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> equals 65. It can also be accessed from the <a onclick="loadFile('Redacted.md')">Redacted</a> room, though the significance of this is unknown.

In this room the Player can listen to four unused music tracks: "Happy Town", "Meat Factory", "Trouble Dingle" and finally "<a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster's</a> Theme" (called *mus_st_him* in the game files). 

The first three are simple looping tracks a few seconds long. 

"Gaster's Theme" is a longer track that cannot be stopped once started. After some time the words "Thanks for your feedback! Be seeing you soon!" appear on the screen and Frisk is thrown out of the room.
- _Gaster's Theme seems to be quoted in many other tracks in UNDERTALE and DELTARNE as a leitmotif. Exactly which tracks reference it is a matter of debate._
    - _The most explicit example is DR's 'Another Him', which plays during the <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">Goner Maker sequence</a>._
- _Will other tracks besides Gaster's Theme have any significance in the future?_
- _The line about 'feedback' might be foreshadowing for the <a onclick="loadFile('DEVICE.md')">SURVEY_PROGRAM</a>._
