**IN UNDERTALE**, Frisk is the 8th human to fall into the Underground. Their <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Soul</a> is the last one <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> needs to destroy the Barrier and free monsterskind.

Frisk's name is only revealed at the end of True Pacifist route. Before that point, the game tricks the player into thinking they chose the protagonist's name at the start of the game, while they were actually naming <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">the Fallen Child.

Despite being a young child, Frisk posseses incredibly high level of Determination. The moment they fall into the Underground, they take control over the timeline from <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>.

As a human, Frisk is often attacked by monsters. They can either fight and kill them, flee from them, or pacify and spare them.

Trying to get back to the surface, Frisk journeys through the Underground, meeting -- and often fighting -- <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>, <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a> and, finally, <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a>, whose <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">soul</a> Frisk must absorb to pass through the Barrier.

On neutral route, Frisk wounds Asgore, who then admits that he doesn't really want to fight. If Frisk doesn't finish Asgore themselves, Flowey intervenes, kills Asgore and shatters his soul. He then absorbs <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">the six human souls</a>, regaining control over the timeline. Flowey fights Frisk and traps them in a death loop, but eventually the human souls rebel against him.
Frisk chooses to either kill or spare <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey </a>and then leaves the Underground.

On a repeated neutral route, <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> tells Frisk that he believes them to be <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">the Angel</a> of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a> and implores them to take his soul and search for a way to free monsters on the surface, before commiting suicide. Flowey then destroys his soul.

Some time later, <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> calls Frisk and tells them about what changed in the Underground after they left. The diallogue changes depending on which major characters were killed by Frisk.
- _The calls assume that Frisk managed to pass throught the Barrier, but it is unclear whether they did or how they did it._

On a True Pacifist route, Frisk spares all monsters they meet, helps <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a> confess her feelings to <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a> and learns the truth about Alphys's experiments in <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">the True Lab</a>.
Everyone Frisk has befriended comes to stop Frisk and <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> from fighting. <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a> ambushes them and absorbs all of their <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">souls</a>, turning back into <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel Dreemur</a>. After a long fight, Frisk makes Asriel realise the error of his actions. Asriel breaks the barrier and returns the souls to their owners. 
Frisk and all their friends emerge on the surface. Frisk has the choice to either stay with <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> or not.

On a Genocide route, Frisk exterminates monsters in each area until the kill counter drops to zero and monsters stop coming. The kill counter is tracked by <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">the Fallen Child</a>, who gradually takes more and more control over the narration and Frisk's actions.
<a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>, believing Frisk to be a reincarnation of the Fallen Child, offers them a plan to steal <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">the human souls</a> and become all-powerful together. However, Frisk / the Fallen Child betray and kill him.
It's unclear what happens to Frisk at the end of the Genocide route.

After the Genocide route is completed, Frisk's soul is permanently bound to <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">the Fallen Child</a>. From this point on, Frisk will take on the Fallen Child's appearance at the end of the True Pacifist route even if they did a True Reset.
