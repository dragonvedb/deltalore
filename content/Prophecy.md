**IN UNDERTALE AND DELTARUNE**, the Prophecies are legends involving the Angel and the Delta Rune, a symbol ubiquitous in both games.

**IN UNDERTALE**, the original meaning of the Delta Rune has been lost to history.

Nowadays, according to Gerson, the triangles are thought to symbolize the monsters trapped in the Underground, while the winged circle depicts an Angel. According to the Prophecy, the Angel who has seen the surface will one day descend to the Underground and free the monsters ("...and the underground will go empty").

In more recent interpretations, the circle is an "Angel of Death" who will fulfil the Prophecy by exterminating all monsters.

**IN DELTARUNE**, the Legend of Deltarune, said to have been foretold by time and space, is explained by Ralsei:

Once upon a time, a LEGEND was whispered among shadows.
It was a LEGEND of HOPE.
It was a LEGEND of DREAMS.
It was a LEGEND of LIGHT.
It was a LEGEND of DARK.
This is the legend of DELTA RUNE
For millenia, LIGHT and DARK have lived in balance,
Bringing peace to the WORLD.
But if this harmony were to shatter...
a terrible calamity would occur.
The sky will run black with terror
And the land will crack with fear.
Then, her heart pounding...
The EARTH will draw her final breath.
Only then, shining with hope...
Three HEROES appear at WORLDS' edge.
A HUMAN,
A MONSTER,
And a PRINCE FROM THE DARK.
Only they can seal the fountains
And banish the ANGEL'S HEAVEN.
Only then will balance be restored,
And the WORLD saved from destruction.
Today, the FOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS-
The geyser that gives this land form-
Stands tall at the center of the kingdom.
But recently, another fountain has appeared on the horizon...
And with it, the balance of LIGHT and DARK begins to shift...

The meaning of Delta Rune is not stated, but the winged circle likely also references the Angel, while the three triangles might symbolize the three heroes, especially considering the coloured version found in Ralsei's castle.

The Delta Rune also appers in Light World, where it seems to be a symbol of Hometown's religion that worships the Angel. What meaning is ascribed to Delta Rune in this religion and how the it connects to the Prophecy is currently unknown.
