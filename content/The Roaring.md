**IN DELTARUNE**, the Roaring is a cataclysm that is supposed to occur if the balance between Light and Dark tips too much in favour of Dark. <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> explains it in effort to stop Berdly from opening another Dark Fountain while already inside a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>.

Ralsei's description is as follows:

_When the LIGHT is subsumed by SHADOW<br>
When the FOUNTAINS fill the sky<br>
All will fall into CHAOS.<br>
The TITANS will take form from the FOUNTAINS<br>
And envelop the land in devastation.<br>
The surviving Darkners, crushed by the darkness<br>
Will slowly, one by one, turn into statues...<br>
Leaving the Lightners to fend for themselves<br>
Lost eternally in an endless night..._

- _The <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> seemingly also describes the Roaring, though it mentions three heroes arriving only after it occurs._
- _<a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> seems to foreshadow the Roaring, saying that "hell's roar is bubbling from the <a onclick="loadFile('Depths.md')">depths</a>"._
- _In Ch2, Queen refers to the <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">Knight</a> as "the Roaring Knight", even though she doesn't know what the Roaring is._ 
	- _This implies that this name was chosen by the Kngiht themselves and that triggering the Roaring is their primary goal._
