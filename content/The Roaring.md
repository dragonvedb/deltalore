IN DELTARUNE, the Roaring is a cataclysm that is supposed to occur if the balance between Light and Dark tips too much in favour of Dark. [[Ralsei]] explains it in effort to stop Berdly from opening another Dark Fountain while already inside a [[Dark Worlds|Dark World]].

Ralsei's description is as follows:
	*When the LIGHT is subsumed by SHADOW  
	When the FOUNTAINS fill the sky  
	All will fall into CHAOS.  
	The TITANS will take form from the FOUNTAINS  
	And envelop the land in devastation.  
	The surviving Darkners, crushed by the darkness  
	Will slowly, one by one, turn into statues...  
	Leaving the Lightners to fend for themselves  
	Lost eternally in an endless night...*

The [[Prophecy]] seemingly also describes the Roaring, though, strangely, it mentions three heroes arriving only after it occurs.

[[Jevil]] foreshadows the Roaring, saying that "hell's roar is bubbling from the depths".

In Ch2 Queen refers to the [[Knight]] as "the Roaring Knight", even though she doesn't know what the Roaring is. The reason for this is unknown.
