**IN DELTARUNE**, the Roaring is a cataclysm that is supposed to occur if the balance between Light and Dark tips too much in favour of Dark. <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a> explains it in effort to stop Berdly from opening another Dark Fountain while already inside a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>.

Ralsei's description is as follows:
- When the LIGHT is subsumed by SHADOW  
- When the FOUNTAINS fill the sky  
- All will fall into CHAOS.  
- The TITANS will take form from the FOUNTAINS  
- And envelop the land in devastation.  
- The surviving Darkners, crushed by the darkness  
- Will slowly, one by one, turn into statues...  
- Leaving the Lightners to fend for themselves  
- Lost eternally in an endless night...

- _The <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">Prophecy</a> seemingly also describes the Roaring, though it mentions three heroes arriving only after it occurs._
- _<a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a> seems to foreshadow the Roaring, saying that "hell's roar is bubbling from the <a onclick="loadFile('Depths.md')">depths</a>"._
- _In Ch2, Queen refers to the <a onclick="loadFile('Knight.md')">Knight</a> as "the Roaring Knight", even though she doesn't know what the Roaring is._ 
	- _This implies that this name was chosen by the Kngiht themselves and that triggering the Roaring is their primary goal._
