IN UNDERTALE, Clam Girl is a character that appears in Waterfall if the [[Fun Events|Fun Value]] is between 80 and 89.

Interacting with her yields this dialogue:
- I'm visiting Waterfall from the city.
- Synchronicity...? My neighbor's daughter looks about your age.
- Her name is "Suzy." I feel like you two should be friends.
- You have... A neighbor's blessing!!!
- Not knowing where I live is no issue. Fate finds a way.
- In life's grand scheme, she might be why you came here in the first place...

After talking to her, a drawing appears in [[Sans' Workshop]] with the words [[don't forget|"don't forget"]] written on it.

If talked to again at the end of the True Pacifist route, Clam Girl tells Frisk that, even though they never met Suzy, they should accept limits on what can be done in one day.
In the Nintendo Switch version, if the [[Fun Events|Fun Value]] equals 81, Clam Girl then turns gray and says that the time Frisk meets Suzy is fast approaching, before disappearing with the sound *snd_mystery_go* (just like [[Mystery Man]] and [[Goner Kid]]). Her gray sprite is named *spr_clam_goner*, again connecting her to Goner Kid and [[Goner Maker]].

IN DELTARUNE, there is a minor character called Clam Guy, who looks exactly like Clam Girl before he is spoken to. His role is to warn [[Kris]] if they missed the encounter with [[Onion]] in Ch1.
