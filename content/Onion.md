**IN UNDERTALE**, Onionsan is an onion-shaped underwater monster living in Waterfall. They are lonely, because all their friends have left for New Home.

**IN DELTARUNE**, a similar monster rises from the lake if <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> comes on its shore in Ch1. They are similarly lonely and desperately want to make a friend. They appear to have a bad memory, to the point they forgot their own name. They ask Kris to give them a new name, with "Onion" being one of the options.

Then, Onion asks Kris to come back tomorrow, because they want to tell them something secret.

If Kris comes back to the shore in Ch2, Onion appears again and tells Kris that they hear a song that is coming from <a onclick="loadFile('Depths.md')">deep underwater</a>. They also say that they heard this song before, but can't remember it, which echoes  Finally, they say that they are going to investigate the source of the song and try to make another friend. They then once again ask Kris to come back tomorrow and then sink back into the lake.

- _What song could it be?_

If Kris didn't meet Onion in Ch1, a character called Clam Guy appears near the lake in Ch2 and says that he saw something in the water yesterday. Strangely, even though this character looks like Clam Guy from UT when being spoken to, he looks like <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">Clam Girl</a> when idle.
