IN UNDERTALE Onionsan is an onion-shaped underwater monster living in Waterfall. They are lonely, because all their friends have left for the aquarium in New Home.

IN DELTARUNE a similar monster rises from the lake if Kris stands on its shore for some time in Ch1. They are similarly lonely and desperately want to make a friend. They appear to have a bad memory and forgot their own name. They ask Kris to give them a new name, with "Onion" being one of the options (though they misremember it on the next day).

Then, Onion asks Kris to come back tomorrow, because they have something they can only tell a friend.

If Kris comes back to the shore in Ch2, Onion appears again and tells Kris that they hear a song that is playing <a onclick="loadFile('Depths.md')">deep underwater</a>. They also say that they heard this song before, but can't remember it, which echoes <a onclick="loadFile('River Person.md')">River Person's</a> line "Did you ever hear the old song coming from the sea?" Finally, they say that they are going to investigate the source of the song and try to make another friend. They then once again ask Kris to come back tomorrow and sink into the lake.

If Kris didn't meet Onion in Ch1, a character called Clam Guy appears near the lake in Ch2 and says that he saw something in the water yesterday. Strangely, even though this character looks like Clam Guy from UT while being spoken to, he look like <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl.md')">Clam Girl</a> while idle.
