**IN UNDERTALE**, Sans is a skeleton living in Snowdin with his younger brother Papyrus. He works as a Royal Guard sentry in multiple posts around the Underground. When Sans isn't slacking off at his job, he does comedy gigs or exchanges puns with Toriel through the Ruins door.

Sans is the first monster Frisk meets after leaving the Ruins. He explains that he is actually uninterested in looking for humans, but asks Frisk to play along and pretend to be captured for the sake of Papyrus.

Over the course of Frisk's journey, Sans occasionally checks up on them, including taking them out to dinner twice (unless Frisk killed Papyrus).

Sans is a comedian and a consummate prankster; outwardly, he is an unserious and lazy, though good-spirited, person.
However, in actuality Sans is far stronger and far more knowledgeable than almost any other monster in the Underground.

He used to study timelines as part of an unspecified research group and is aware of the possibility of time travel. This burdens him, since he is aware that all of his accomplishments and memories can ultimately be undone by someone with sufficiently high Detremination.

Sans believes Frisk to be the Anomaly that will, according to his research, cause the end of the universe. Despite this, Sans doesn't immediately kill Frisk, because he promised Toriel to protect any human that comes out of the Ruins. Instead, he observes their behaviour and tries to steer them away from violence.

In the Last Corridor on the way to Asgore's house, Sans meets Frisk and explains the meaning of some in-game terms like XP (which stands for 'execution points') and LV (which stands for 'Level of Violence'). Then, he gives Frisk his judgement, which depends on how many monsters Frisk killed, and on whether they killed Papyrus.

If Frisk reloads several times before hearing the judgement, Sans begins to suspect that Frisk might be a time traveler. He tells Frisk a secret password and asks to repeat it to him after the next reload. After hearing the password, Sans gives Frisk the key to his room, with the words "it's time you learn the truth".
The room turns out to be a prank, but the Silver Key can be found inside of it, which unlocks Sans's Workshop. The workshop contains several strange items from Sans's past. If Frisk previously finished the True Pacifist route, there will also be a photograph of Sans, Frisk and all of their friends on the surface, suggesting he can somehow safeguard objects from resets. 

On the Genocide route, Sans breaks his promise to Toriel and fights Frisk, despite knowing that they can rewind time indefinitely. Sans nominally has the weakest attack and defence stats among all monsters, both sitting at 1. However, his attacks are extremely varied and hard to dodge, and his KARMA ability massively reduces invulnerability period between hits and inflicts stacking damage-over-time. He is, to some extent, aware of the game's battle mechanics and can break some of them, such as attacking Frisk on their turn or side-stepping all of Frisk's attacks, making it impossible to defeat him in normal combat.

After some time though, Sans becomes tired and cannot keep up his attacks anymore. As a last resort, he declares that he intends to do nothing on his combat turn, so that Frisk will never get theirs. Frisk eventually circumvents this by waiting for Sans to fall asleep and moving the entire battle box towards the 'FIGHT' button. Sans dodges the first attack, but is mortally wounded by the second one.

One of Sans's most prominent weapons are Gaster Blasters, which is the only thing that directly connects him to Dr. Gaster.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Sans has only recently moved into Hometown together with Papyrus. He runs the "'sans" grocery store, which looks like the Grillby's diner from UT with the name scrubbed off.

Kris has the option to greet Sans like an old friend, which makes Sans point it out as weird.

In Ch1 Sans asks Kris to come over and play with his brother tomorrow. In Ch2 though, he says that the plans have changed and Kris can't meet his brother today.
