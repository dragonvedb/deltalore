IN UNDERTALE _mus_smile_ is a sound track that plays while <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a> is being printed out.

IN DELTARUNE the same track plays whenever <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> tries to call <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> from inside a <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">|
The same phrase is used by the Addisons who tell <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton's</a> story. He became a successful salesman once he began regularly speaking to someone on the phone. But once the calls stopped, his fortunes turned. The day he was to be evicted from Queen's Mansion, one of the Addisons went to check up on him and found a phone with a hanging handle, which emitted garbage noise.
- _Is Gaster the person who helped Spamton, and then drove him (probably along with <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil</a>) insane?_
- _Is this noise the sound of Gaster speaking? Can its meaning be discerned somehow?_
- _Why is it called 'smile'?_

_mus_smile_ slowed down by 666% can also be heard near the <a onclick="loadFile('Bunker.md')">Bunker</a>. The significance of this is unknown.
