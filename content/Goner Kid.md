**IN UNDERTALE**, Goner Kid is a character that appears in Waterfall if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events')">Fun Value</a> is between 90  and 100. They look like a gray white-eyed version of Monster Kid.
- _Monster Kid mentions that they have a sister. Could she be the Goner Kid?_

Their dialogue is:
- _Have you ever thought about a world where everything is exactly the same..._
- _Except you don't exist?_
- _Everything functions perfectly without you..._
- _Ha, ha... The thought terrifies me._

However, if <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk')">Frisk</a> holds an umbrella, they instead say:
- _An umbrella...? But it's not raining._
- _Ha, ha..._
- _You know, that does make me feel a little better about this._
- _Thank you._
- _Please forget about me._
- _Please don't think about this anymore._

If talked to while in Debug Mode, they say *"Yo! You're aÂ ??? too, right?"*. The significance of this is unknown.

- _Their dialogue might be an allegory on <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster')">Dr. Gaster's</a> fate, being erased from reality and replaced by <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys')">Alphys</a>._
    - _This, as well as asking Frisk to forget about them might connect Goner Kid with another goner -- <a onclick="loadFile('Clam Girl')">Clam Girl</a> -- and with DELTARUNE, through the phrase <a onclick="loadFile('don\'t forget')">"don't forget"</a>._
