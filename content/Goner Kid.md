IN UNDERTALE, Goner Kid is a character that appears in Waterfall if the [[Fun Events|Fun Value]] is between 90  and 100. They look like a gray white-eyed version of Monster Kid.

Their dialogue is:
- _Have you ever thought about a world where everything is exactly the same..._
- _Except you don't exist?_
- _Everything functions perfectly without you..._
- _Ha, ha... The thought terrifies me._

However, if Frisk holds an umbrella, they instead say:
- _An umbrella...? But it's not raining._
- _Ha, ha..._
- _You know, that does make me feel a little better about this._
- _Thank you._
- _Please forget about me._
- _Please don't think about this anymore._

If talked to while in Debug Mode, they say "_Yo! You're aÂ ??? too, right?_". The significance of this is unknown.
