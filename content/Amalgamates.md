IN UNDERTALE Amalgamates are monsters on the verge of death, who became changed after being injected with Determination as part of [[Alphys|Alphys's]] experiments in the [[Hotland Lab|True Lab]]. As detailed in the Log Entries, including the missing [[Entry 17]], this was done to try and preserve their [[Souls]] after death. However, instead of dying, the subjects first seemingly returned to good health and then began melting and merging together, since their bodies were unable to handle excess Determination.

Alphys hid the truth from the rest of monsterkind and continued to care for Amalgamates in secret.

Amalgamates are not necessarily aggressive, but many will attack [[Frisk]], thinking they may have food. During fights, they often appear glitched, breaking game mechanics and UI elements.

Known Amalgamates are:

**Memoryheads** are composed of multiple monsters and also seem to be connected to some electronic device.
- _There may be several hints that Memoryheads are connected to W. D. Gaster:_
	- _One of their attacks include faces that look similar to Mystery Man's face_
	- *[[Frisk]] has to use a cellphone in their presence to spare them; in UNDERTALE, three of the [[Fun Events]] involve [[Misplaced Calls|strange phone calls]]; in DELTARUNE, using a cellphone in a Dark World makes it play [[mus_smile]] and Spamton goes mad after speaking to someone on the phone.*
	- _One of the lines that appear during the fight is "Lorem ipsum docet", which is a reference to Lorem Ipsum placeholder text, but also can be translated from Latin as "Pain itself teaches" (except 'lorem' should be 'dolorem'). There is a similar line in the [[Pain Poem]], which also includes a description of the [[Mystery Man]]._

**Reaper Bird** is composed of Final Froggit, Astigmatism and Whimsalot. Curiously, all of their attacks involve [[Everyman]], whose exact nature is unclear.

**Endogeny** is composed of multiple dog monsters, relatives of the dogs living in Snowdin. In the end of True Pacifist, they are reunited with their family members.
In DELTARUNE, there is a tombstone with the name Muttler on it near the [[Church]].

**Lemon Bread** is Shyren's sister melded together with Moldbygg and Aaron. In the end of True Pacifist, they are reunited with Shyren.
In DELTARUNE, there is a tombstone with the name Shyra on it near the Church.

**Snowdrake's Mother** is mixed together with parts of sixteen other monsters. In the end of True Pacifist, she is reunited with her family.

**Watching Man** appears is Frisk lies down in one of the beds. It slowly extends its hand, pats Frisk on the head and disappears. Its name is only mentioned in game files.

There is also a strange swinging shape in the bedroom and a mention of "something in the shape of a man" in the fog-filled refrigerator room, which might be the same as the Watching Man or separate entities.

In DELTARUNE, there are a tombstones with the names Muttler, Shyra and Crystal on them near the [[Church]]. These likely reference Endogeny, Lemon Bread and Snowdrake's Mother.
