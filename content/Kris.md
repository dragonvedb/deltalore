**IN DELTARUNE**, Kris is the adopted child of the Dreemurr family and, presumably, one of the three heroes of the Prophecy.

Kris is a quiet, introverted kid with few friends.

Being seemingly the only human in Hometown, they feel somewhat uncomfortable with their nature as a human. 
As a child, they thought they would grow horns like the rest of their adopted family and would wear a horn headband to try and fit in. 
When inspecting the book on raising human children, they hastily close it after seeing pictures of other humans.

They have a very close relationship with <a onclick="loadFile('Asriel.md')">Asriel</a>, though now that Asriel is away in college, they can only talk via the internet.

They are on good terms with <a onclick="loadFile('Noelle.md')">Noelle</a>, despite her often being the target of Kris's pranks ever since they were kids.

Kris seems reluctant to participate in <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">church</a>, school or sporting activities. Their side of the room is noticebly barren of trophies compared to Asriel's. However, they enjoy playing the piano and have studied black magic together with Catty.

<a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a> used to bully Kris more agressively than other kids. Despite this, they manage to become good friends during their adventures in the <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark World</a>. Susie Tea heals Kris more than Noelle's or Ralsei's, indicating their strong bond.

In the Dark Worlds, Kris is the de-facto leader of the party, choosing where to go, issuing orders in battle and making most of the important decisions. This is upheld by <a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei</a>, who insists on Kris having the freedom to choose, and always follows their lead.

Since at least the start of Ch1, Kris is being controlled by -- or through -- <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">the Red Soul</a>. The Soul decides on most of what they do or say, though they retain some amount of freedom in how they execute the orders; this ranges from pronouncing the lines in a puzzled way, to outright sabotage, like Kris closing their eyes when ordered to look inside a room themed around Asriel's search queries.

Kris's Soul is the only known thing that can seal Dark Fountains.

Kris is able to remove the Red Soul from their body. This allows them to act of their own volition and prevents the Soul from observing them. However, while soulless (and in Ch1, immediately before ripping the Soul out) Kris moves in a weird, staggered fashion. They always eventually put the Soul back in.

In Ch1, after removing the Soul, Kris throws the Soul into a cage, walks to the center of the room, pulls out their knife and smiles menacingly at the camera.

In Ch2, Kris rips their <a onclick="loadFile('Red Souls.md')">Soul</a> out twice. 
The first time, they do it to sneak out of the house and slash the tires on <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel's</a> car, forcing <a onclick="loadFile('Susie.md')">Susie</a> to stay over for the night and making Toriel call the police. 
The second time, they turn on the TV, open the front door and then create a Dark Fountain in the middle of the living room.

- _What are Kris's goals and motivations?_
    - _If they are the Knight, then what do they gain by opening Dark Fountains, considering they are aware of their dangerous nature and the possibility of causing <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>?_
        - _And are they defying or actually following <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a> by doing so?_
        - _Perhaps Kris is looking for something inside <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">the Dark Worlds</a>. For instance, trying to find <a onclick="loadFile('Dess Holiday.md')">Dess</a> or find a way to shake off Player's control._
    - _Kris's actions after removing the Soul seem very precise and premediated. It's not shown explicitly, but they likely plugged the TV in after the end of Ch1 and then turned it on opened the Dark Fountain in the same room at the end of Ch2. This suggests they have some degree of future knowledge. It could come from the Prophecy, Ralsei, Dr. Gaster..._

- _Did Kris have a <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Soul</a> before it was replaced/hijacked by the Player?_
    - _The description of the bird cage wagon states that "looks like it's seen quite a few crashes" and there's a red stain nearby. This hints that Kris has removed their Soul many times before. It's unclear whether they did it because they were controlled by someone else before the Player, as a form of self-harm or for some other reason._

- _Kris shares several similarities with UNDERTALE's <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a>:_
    - _They are an adopted human child of the Dreemurr family._
    - _They wear a similar green-yellow striped shirt._
    - _They have an affinity for knives, and own one._
    - _They have a sweet tooth._
    - _They are shown to have glowing red eyes, similar to Chara-possesed Frisk (though there is debate on weather the eye colour is due to possesion or their natural eye colour)._
    - _After they fall out of bed at the end of Ch1, the sprites of them getting up are similar to those of Chara standing up after falling into the Underground._

- _Kris also shares some traits with <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a>:_
    - _Their have a similar skin tone and the same neutral expression_
    - _Their name is almost an anagram of Frisk's, missing only the letter 'F'._
    - _Just ike with Frisk. the Player is initially misled into thinking they are going to be playing as another character, whom they can name (<a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">Chara</a> in UT, <a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">the Vessel</a> in DR); while in actuality the protagonist has a defined name._

- _There is an unused sprite in UNDERTALE that looks similar to Kris, with a striped shirt and a face shadowed by hair. The significance of this is unknown._
