**IN DELTARUNE**, Kris is the adopted child of the Dreemurr family and, presumably, one of the three heroes of the Prophecy.

Kris is a quiet, introverted kid with few friends.
They have a very close relationship with Asriel, though now that Asriel is away in college, they can only talk via the internet.
They are on good terms with Noelle, despite her often being the target of Kris's pranks ever since they were kids.
Susie used to bully Kris. One time, when Susie threatened to "make them disappear", Kris responded with something that made Susie storm out of the room. 
Despite this, Kris and Susie manage to become best friends during their adventures in the Dark World. Susie Tea heals Kris more than Noelle's or Ralsei's, indicating their strong bond.

In the Dark Worlds, Kris is the de-facto leader of the Fun Gang, choosing directions, issuing orders in battle and making most of the important decisions. This is upheld by Ralsei, who insists on Kris having the freedom to choose, and always follows their lead.

Being seemingly the only human in Hometown, Kris feels somewhat uncomfortable with their nature as a human. 
As a child, they thought they would grow horns like the rest of their adopted family and would wear a horn headband to try and fit in. 
If inspecting the book on raising human children, they hastily close it after seeing pictures of other humans.

Kris seems reluctant to participate in church, school or sporting activities. Their side of the room is noticebly barren of trophies compared to Asriel's. However, they enjoy playing the piano and have studied black magic together with Catty.

Kris has told other kids about something terrifying hidden inside the Bunker. Notably, after visiting the Bunker in Ch2, Susie feels the need to ask Kris if they are okay.

Since at least the start of Ch1, Kris is being controlled by -- or through -- the Red Soul. The Soul decides on most of what they do or say, though they retain some amount of freedom in how they execute the orders; this ranges from pronouncing the lines in a puzzled way, to outright sabotage, like Kris closing their eyes when ordered to look inside a room themed around Asriel's search queries.

Multiple characters note that Kris is looking and acting strangely lately, as if they are sick. They also cannot play the piano anymore.

Since their Soul is the only thing that can seal Dark Fountains, Kris is an integral part of the Prophecy. Ralsei

Kris is able to remove the Red Soul from their body. This allows them to act of their own volition and prevents the Soul from observing them. However, while soulless (and in Ch1, immediately before ripping the Soul out) Kris moves in a weird, staggered fashion. 
They always eventually put the Soul back in.

In Ch1, after removing the Soul, Kris throws the Soul into a cage, walks to the center of the room, pulls out their knife and smiles menacingly at the camera. 

In Ch2, Kris rips their Soul out twice. 
The first time, they do it to sneak out of the house and slash the tires on Toriel's car, forcing Susie to stay over for the night and making Toriel call the police. 
The second time, they turn on the TV, open the front door and then create a Dark Fountain in the middle of the living room.
