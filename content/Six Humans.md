IN UNDERTALE. six humans fell into the Underground between the times of Chara and Frisk. All of them died in one way or another. Their bodies were laid to rest in coffins inside the palace, and their [[Souls]] were preserved by [[Asgore]] in special glass containers.

The [[souls]] of the six humans each have a unique colour and associated trait. These are known through the Ball Game, where the colour and description of the flag changes depending on the amount of time needed to complete thr game.

Each human possessed their own armour and weapon, which were scattered across the Underground after their deaths.

Below is the list of humans with their associated traits and items. Since their names are unknown, they are identified by the colours of their souls:
- **Light Blue.** Patience. Toy Knife and Faded Ribbon are found in the Ruins.
- **Orange.** Bravery. Tough Glove and Manly Bandana are sold by the Snowdin Shopkeeper.
- **Blue.** Integrity. Ballet Shoes and Old Tutu are found in Waterfall.
- **Purple.** Perseverance. Torn Notebook and Cloudy Glasses are sold by [[Gerson Boom|Gerson]].
- **Green.** Kindness. Burnt Pan and Stained Apron are found in Hotland.
- **Yellow.** Justice. Empty Gun and Cowboy Hat are sold by Catty and Bratty.

In the Neutral route [[Flowey]] absorbs the souls of the six humans which gives him enough [[Determination]] to take control of the timeline back from [[Frisk]]. However, they end up rebelling against him.

In the end of True Pacifist route, after Asriel destroys the Barrier, the coffins in the Palace's basement are shown to be open and empty.

IN DELTARUNE, the six humans do not appear. However, in [[Flower King|Asgore's flower shop]] seven flowers are kept preserved in jars, their colours (except for one golden flower) reminiscent of the six human souls. The significance of this is unknown.
