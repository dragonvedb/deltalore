**IN DELTARUNE**, the Man Behind the Tree is a mysterious character that can be found in both Ch1 and Ch2 in a hidden room. 

The room can be accessed with 2% chance when transitioning between the <a onclick="loadFile('Starwalker.md')">Starwalker</a> Bird room and the darkening room (in Ch1), or between the Dog Dumpster room and the traffic jam room (in Ch2). The room is empty, save for a single tree with a trail leading up to it and has its own background music (_man.ogg_); Kris appears there alone, further giving it an "out of bounds" feel.
- _Why is the hidden room adjacent to "unserious" content in both chapters? Does that make it more important, or more unimportant?_

Checking the tree yields "He is behind the tree" and checking behind yields "Well, there is a man here". The Man then offers something to Kris; accepting adds an <a onclick="loadFile('Egg.md')">Egg</a> to the inventory. Either way, the Man disappears. Checking the tree afterwards yields "Well, there is not a man here".
- _Why is attention drawn to the character <a onclick="loadFile('Mysterious Men.md')">being a man</a>? Could he be connected to <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a>? <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>?_
	- _Is it a coincidence that the tree room looks similar to the Fake Hallway?_

If Kris previously received an egg, in Ch 2 a man will appear inside one of the cars on the way to school and wave at them. The significance of this is unknown.

**IN UNDERTALE's** <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">True Lab</a> there is a fog-filled refrigerator room. Inspecting two of the fridges yields "_Something that feels like a tree, ripe with delicious fruit_" and "_Something in <a onclick="loadFile('Mysterious Men.md')">the shape of a man</a>_". It's nclear if these are related to the Man Behind the Tree.
