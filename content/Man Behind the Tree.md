**IN DELTARUNE**, the Man Behind the Tree is a mysterious character that can be found in both Ch1 and Ch2 in a hidden room. 

This room can be accessed with 2% chance when transitioning between the <a onclick="loadFile('Starwalker.md')">Starwalker</a> Bird room and the darkening room in Ch1; and between the Dog Dumpster room and the traffic jam room in Ch2 (there is a graffitio of the tree with the caption "The room between... There is a room between."). 

The room is empty, save for a single tree with a trail leading up to it and has its own background music (_man.ogg_); Kris appears there alone, further giving it an "out of bounds" feel.
- _The hidden room is adjacent to weird, "unserious" content in both chapters: the Starwalker in Ch1, Annoying Dog and moss in Ch2. Does that make it more important, or more unimportant?_

Checking the tree yields "He is behind the tree" and checking behind yields "Well, there is a man here. He offered you something". Accepting adds an <a onclick="loadFile('Egg.md')">Egg</a> to the inventory. Either way, the Man disappears. Checking the tree afterwards yields "Well, there is not a man here".
- _Attention is drawn to the character being a man, which could connect him to other mysterious men like <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Gaster</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Everyman.md')">Everyman</a>._
	- _The tree room is similar to the Fake Hallway both in layout and in being a "room between" with a tiny chance to appear._

If Kris previously received an egg, in Ch 2 a man will appear inside one of the cars in Hometown and wave at them. The significance of this is unknown.

- _In UNDERTALE's <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">True Lab</a> there is a fog-filled refrigerator room. Inspecting two of the fridges yields "Something that feels like a tree, ripe with delicious fruit" and "Something in <a onclick="loadFile('Mysterious Men.md')">the shape of a man</a>". It's unclear if these are related to the Man Behind the Tree._
