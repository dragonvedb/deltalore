IN DELTARUNE the Man Behind the Tree is a mysterious character that can be found in both Ch1 and Ch2 in a hidden room. 

The room can be accessed with 2% chance when transitioning between the [[Starwalker]] Bird room and the darkening room (in Ch1), or between the Dog Dumpster room and the traffic jam room (in Ch2). The room is empty, save for a single tree with a trail leading up to it and has its own background music (_man.ogg_); Kris appears there alone, further giving it an "out of bounds" feel.
- _Why is the hidden room adjacent to "unserious" content in both chapters? Does that make it more important, or more unimportant?_

Checking the tree yields "He is behind the tree" and checking behind yields "Well, there is a man here". The Man then offers something to Kris; accepting adds an [[Egg]] to the inventory. Either way, the Man disappears. Checking the tree afterwards yields "Well, there is not a man here".
- _Why is attention drawn to the character [[Mysterious Men|being a man]]? Could he be connected to [[Doctor W. D. Gaster|Gaster]]? [[Everyman]]?_
	- _Is it a coincidence that the tree room looks similar to the Fake Hallway?_

If Kris received the egg in Ch 2, a man will appear inside one of the cars on the way to school and wave at them.

IN UNDERTALE's [[Hotland Lab|True Lab]] there is a fog-filled refrigerator room. Inspecting two of the fridges yields "_Something that feels like a tree, ripe with delicious fruit_" and "_Something in [[Mysterious Men|the shape of a man]]_". Unclear if these are related.
