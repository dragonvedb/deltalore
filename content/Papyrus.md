**IN UNDERTALE**, Papyrus is a skeleton living in Snowdin with his older brother <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a>. He is training to become a member of the Royal Guard under <a onclick="loadFile('Undyne.md')">Undyne</a> (though she secretely doesn't want him to join). 

Papyrus is extremely friendly, optimistic and self-assured, to hte point of infantility. He dreams of capturing a human, believing that it will win him friends, fame and adoration of the masses, which is his main motivation.
Sans knows, that deep down Papyrus feels lonely, so he asks <a onclick="loadFile('Frisk.md')">Frisk</a> to play along with Papyrus's attempts at capturing them.

<a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey likes toying with Papyrus during his resets. He pretends to be his friend and gives him predictions of the future. 
In the end of True Pacifist route, Flowey manipulates Papyrus to call all of Frisks friends and tell them to come to the Throne Room, where Flowey ambushes them and absorbs their <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">Souls</a>.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Papyrus has not appeared as of yet. He is, presumably, the younger brother that <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> mentions to <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>. 

In Ch1, Sans asks Kris to come over and play with his brother tomorrow. In Ch2 though, he says that the plans have changed and Kris can't meet his brother today.

If Kris comes to Sans's house, they can hear "a trousle of bones", which is a reference to 'Bonetrousle', Papyrus's theme in UT.
