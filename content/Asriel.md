**IN UNDERTALE**, Asriel Dreemurr is the only son of <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a>. He was the one who found the <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">first fallen child</a> in the Ruins and brought them home. Asriel became very attached to the Fallen Child, and was eventually manipulated by them to absorb their <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">soul</a> and go through the barrier in order to kill humans. However, at the last moment Asriel refused to attack and was mortally wounded. He managed to get back to the Throne Room and died there. 

His essence was absorbed by a golden flower, which was then injected with <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> by <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>, creating <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>, a soulless being with Asriel's memories and control over the timeline.

In the True Pacifist route, after absorbing <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">six human souls</a>, as well as souls of most of the monsters in the Underground, Flowey transforms into an adult form of Asriel named "The Absolute God of Hyperdeath". He tells Frisk (whom he believes to be the Fallen Child) that he intends to reset the timeline and start their game all over again.

Eventually, Frisk is able to show Asriel that what he's doing is wrong. Asriel takes on the appearance he had before death, breaks the Barrier and returns the souls back to their owners.

Becoming soulless again, Asriel is doomed to turn back into Flowey. He goes back to the golden flower bed in the Ruins to await his fate.

- _Asriel might be the Angel from the legend told by <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson.md')">Gerson</a>. He has see the surface descended back to the Underground and freed monsterkind._
 - _- _Asriel's name is similar to 'Azrael', an Angel of Death in Islam.__

**IN DELTARUNE**, Asriel is Kris's older adopted brother. He is currently studying in college outside Hometown, but is supposed to visit next week.

Asriel cares deeply about Kris. He constantly tried to accomodate them and shelter them from hardsips; for instance, he continued to take them to the diner even after <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> divorced, carried them to school when they woke up late and would take the knock-off controller, so that Kris could use the original one. 

Asriel's accomplishments and popularity are emphasized at many points. His side of the room is full of trophies and medals, in contrast to Kris's. He was a cross-country runner and participated in the <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">Church</a> choir. He is mentioned positively by Pizzapants, Catty, <a onclick="loadFile('Father Alvin.md')">Father Alvin</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Onion.md')">Onion</a>.

Asriel's God of Hyperdeath form from UT is referenced twice: as a character from Asriel's in-development game and as an angel doll that Asriel and Kris never finished because he kept making the wings larger.

<a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei's</a> name is an anagram of 'Asriel', and the two look somewhat similar. The significance of this is, as of yet, unknown.
