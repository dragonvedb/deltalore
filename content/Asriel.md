**IN UNDERTALE**, Asriel Dreemurr is the only son of Asgore and Toriel. He was the one who found the <a onclick="loadFile('The Fallen Child (Chara).md')">first fallen child</a> in the Ruins and brought them home. Asriel became very attached to the Fallen Child, and was eventually manipulated by them to absorb their <a onclick="loadFile('Souls.md')">soul</a> and go through the barrier in order to kill humans. However, at the last moment Asriel refused to attack and was mortally wounded. He managed to get back to the Throne Room and died there. 

His essence was absorbed by a golden flower, which was then injected with <a onclick="loadFile('Determination.md')">Determination</a> by <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>, creating <a onclick="loadFile('Flowey.md')">Flowey</a>, a soulless being with Asriel's memories and control over the timeline.

In the True Pacifist route, after absorbing <a onclick="loadFile('Six Humans.md')">six human souls</a>, as well as souls of most of the monsters in the Underground, Flowey turns into a grown-up version of Asriel. He attacks Frisk with a flurry of attacks, culminating in the "Hyper Goner". Still unable to win, he transforms into a more powerful form called "The Absolute God of Hyperdeath".

Eventually, Frisk is able to remind Asriel of the person he used to be. Asriel takes on the appearance he had before death and breaks the barrier, returning the souls back to their owners.
- _Is Asriel the angel from the legend told by <a onclick="loadFile('Gerson.md')">Gerson</a>? He has seen the surface, came back and freed monsterkind._

Becoming soulless again, Asriel is doomed to turn back into Flowey. He goes back to the golden flower bed in the Ruins to await his fate.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Asriel is Kris's older adopted sibling. He is currently studying in college outside Hometown, but is supposed to visit next week.

Asriel cares deeply about Kris. He continued to take them to the diner even after <a onclick="loadFile('Asgore.md')">Asgore</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Toriel.md')">Toriel</a> divorced, carried them to school when they woke up late and would take a knock-off controller, so that Kris could use the better one. 

Asriel's accomplishments and popularity are emphasized at many points. His side of the room is full of trophies and medals, in contrast to Kris's. He was a cross-country runner, participated in the <a onclick="loadFile('Church.md')">church</a> choir and seems to be rather religious in general. He is mentioned positively by Pizzapants, Catty, <a onclick="loadFile('Father Alvin.md')">Father Alvin</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Onion.md')">Onion</a>.

Asriel's God of Hyperdeath form is referenced twice: as a character from Asriel's in-development game and as an angel doll that Asriel never finished because he kept making the wings bigger.

<a onclick="loadFile('Ralsei.md')">Ralsei's</a> name is an anagram of 'Asriel', and the two look somewhat similar. The significance of this is, as of yet, unknown.
