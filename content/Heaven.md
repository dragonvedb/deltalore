**IN DELTARUNE**, Heaven is a concept mentioned a few times.

<a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">The Prophecy</a> speaks of three heroes "banishing the Angel's Heaven". The wording implies that this is supposed to occur after <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>.

<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> wants to ascend to Heaven, associating it with freedom. To achieve this, he finds a new body created by a Lightner (likely <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a>) and attempts to steal <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">the Red Soul</a> from <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>.

- _How is <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">the Angel</a> related to Heaven?_
- _What is meant by "banishing" Heaven?_

- _Why does Spamton think the Red Soul would allow him to ascend to Heaven?_
    - _Is such an ascension possible?_
