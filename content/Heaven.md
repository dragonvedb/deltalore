**IN DELTARUNE**, Heaven is a concept mentioned in <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a>, which speaks of three heroes "banishing the <a onclick="loadFile('Angel.md')">Angel's</a> Heaven". The wording implies that this is supposed to occur after <a onclick="loadFile('The Roaring.md')">the Roaring</a>.
- _Is Heaven an actual or metaphorical place? How does Angel relate to it?_
    - _If Angel is indeed the Player, then Heaven would likely represent reality outside the game; something which is to the Light World, like what Light World is to a Dark World._
- _What is meant by "banishing" Heaven?_
    - _Preventing it from interfering with the Light and <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">Dark Worlds</a>?_

<a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton</a> wants to ascend to Heaven, associating it with freedom. To achieve this, he finds a new body created by a Lightner (likely <a onclick="loadFile('Mettaton.md')">Mettaton</a>) and attempts to steal <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">the Red Soul</a> from <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a>.

- _It's unclear why Spamton believes the Red Soul will allow hims to ascend and whether that is possuble in principle._
