**IN UNDERTALE**, Determination is a property of Souls, that allows their bearers to bend some rules of reality. Alpys, who coined the term, describes it as "The will to keep living... The resolve to change fate."

Humans have much stronger Determination than monsters, which is why their souls can persist after death.

Determination can be harvested from human souls using a special machine named D.T. Extractor, which Alphys built in the True Lab using older bluprints.
Harvested Determination can be injected into living creatures. However, bodies of monsters can't handle such high levels of Determination and begin to melt. While melting, several monsters can become conjoined, forming Amalgamates.

Something similar happens to Undyne; due to unusually strong natural Determination, she can fight on despite mortal injuries, but after some time her body simply dissolves.
On Genocide route, however, Undyne's level of Determintaion becomes so high, she transforms into a much stronger and hardier form named Undyne the Undying; though she still melts after sustaining enough damage.

Determination can be injected into non-sentient beings that don't have a soul. The only known example of such a being is Flowey - a flower that absorbed Asriel's essence. After gaining a large dose of Determination, Flowey not only became sentient, with Asriel's memories preserved, but gained the ability to manipulate the timeline by Saving and Loading. This effectively makes him immortal, as he can always choose to go back to an earlier save point at the moment of death.

Frisk possesses even more Determination then Flowey. When they fall into the Underground, they take the Save and Load abilities from Flowey. Flowey's high Determination lets him retain memories between reloads, though.
After the end of True Pacifist route, Frisk can do a True Reset. This rewinds time to the moment they first fell and is strong enough to wipe even Flowey's memories.

Determination and Soul Power appear to be separate concepts. However, it is possible to increase one's Determination by absorbing human souls. When Flowey does so, he retakes control of the timeline from Frisk and can even create up to six separate Save files, one for each soul absorbed.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Determination is the ability to open Dark Fountains, possesed by all Lightners, both Humans and Monsters.

Save points in DR don't mention Determination, typically using the phrase "power \[...] shines within you" or "you are filled with power" instead.

Saving and loading in general seems to be managed by a separate entity, at least before Ch1 is completed.
