**IN DELTARUNE**, the Vessel is an entity created by the Player during the <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">Goner Maker</a> sequence.

Under <a onclick="loadFile('Doctor W. D. Gaster.md')">Dr. Gaster's</a> guidance, the Player first constructs its body choosing from several head, torso and leg options. 
Then, they pick the Vessel's favourite food, blood type, favourite colour and a gift (out of 'Kindness', 'Mind', 'Ambition', 'Bravery' and 'Voice').
Finally the Player gives the Vessel a <a onclick="loadFile('Name Selector.md')">name</a>.

In the end of the Goner Maker sequence, <a onclick="loadFile('Third Entity.md')">an unknown character</a> intervenes, announcing that the Vessel will be discarded and that the Player is going to control <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> instead.

However, the values chosen during the Vessel's creation are still saved in the game files.
- What happened to the Vessel and where is it currently located?
    - Is Vessel the one leaving <a onclick="loadFile('Messages in the Code.md')">messages in the code</a>?
- If the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Red Soul</a> was originally supposed to control the Vessel, what role was <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> inteded to play in the story?
