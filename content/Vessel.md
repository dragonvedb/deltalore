**IN DELTARUNE**, the Vessel is an entity created by the Player during the <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">Goner Maker</a> sequence.

Under Dr. Gaster's guidance, the Player first constructs its body choosing from several head, torso and leg options. 
Then, they pick the Vessel's favourite food, blood type, favourite colour and a gift (out of 'Kindness', 'Mind', 'Ambition', 'Bravery' and 'Voice').
Finally the Player gives the Vessel a <a onclick="loadFile('Name Selector.md')">name</a>.

In the end of the Goner Maker sequence, <a onclick="loadFile('Third Entity.md')">an unknown character</a> intervenes, announcing that the Vessel will be discarded and that the Player is going to control <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> instead.

However, the values chosen during the Vessel's creation are still saved in the game files.
- Is the Vessel going to return in the future?
    - If so, where is it currently located?
        - Is Vessel the one leaving <a onclick="loadFile('Messages in the Code.md')">messages in the code</a>?
- If the <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">Red Soul</a> was originally supposed to control the Vessel, what role was <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris</a> inteded to play in the <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">prophecy</a>?
