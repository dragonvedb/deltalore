**IN UNDERTALE AND DELTARUNE**, Doctor W. D. Gaster is a mysterious hidden character.
He seems to be extremely important to the overarching narrative of both games, yet little is known about him definitively.

**IN UNDERTALE**, Doctor W. D. Gaster is a secret side-character, featured only in rare random events and unused game code.

Most of the information related to Dr. Gaster comes from the so-called "<a onclick="loadFile('Gaster Followers.md')">Gaster Followers</a>", that have a chance to appear in various locations around Hotland if the hidden <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is set to 61, 62, or 63. They explain that Doctor W. D. Gaster was a brilliant inventor, who created the <a onclick="loadFile('CORE.md')">CORE</a> and held the position of Royal Scientist before <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>. 

One day he "fell down into his creation"; however, instead of dying, he ended up shattered across time and space. The exact implications of this are unknown. One of the followers implies that Dr. Gaster is currently listening to them talking. Another claims to hold a piece of Gaster in their hand.

The apperance of Doctor W. D. Gaster is unknown, but is widely believed to be the <a onclick="loadFile('Mystery Man.md')">Mystery Man</a>, who has a 10% chance to appear if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is at 66.

Another Fun Event, the <a onclick="loadFile('Sound Test.md')">Sound Test</a> room, includes the "Gaster Theme" among other unused tracks.

More information about Dr. Gaster can be found in the game code. He has unused battle stats, all of which are strings of 6's.

There's also an unused room named *room_gaster* which prints out the missing <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a> in uppercase Wingdings, a font that replaces letters with various symbols. The typer value for Entry 17 (which determines how the text is rendered) is equal to '666'.

The name W. D. Gaster is likely a reference to the Wingdings font. Other characters named after fonts are <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>. How Gaster is related to them is unknown.

Sans is also directly linked to Dr. Gaster by the fact that his weapons are called "Gaster Blasters" in the game files.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Dr. Gaster features much more prominently, but, as of yet, his name has not been mentioned.

Even before the release of DELTARUNE, an image with the name _him.png_ was posted on deltarune.com. The image contains very faint text in Wingdings that reads "THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT SEEMS VERY VERY INTERESTING", a quote from Entry 17. Later, the image was changed to say "THREE HEROES APPEARED TO BANISH ANGELS HAVEN", which is a rephrasing of a part of the Prophecy.

The release of Survey Program was announced on Twitter by an account with a blacked out name, writing in a tone similar to that of Entry 17.

When the Survey Program is launched, Dr. Gaster establishes the connection to the Player. When the Red Soul appears, he starts the Goner Maker sequence and guides the Player through the process creating a Vessel for, until it is interrupted by an unknown speaker.

Afterwards, Gaster seems to assist the Player with Save file management, at least until the end of Ch1.

_mus\_smile_, the sound that playes over Entry 17 in UT, is featured several times.

It plays in the vicinity of the Bunker, though slowed down by 666%.

It is heard whenever Kris tries to make a phone call while in the Dark World. The narration describes it as "garbage noise".
"Garbage noise" also played when Spamton tried to contact his mysterious caller.
