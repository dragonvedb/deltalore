*Doctor W. D. Gaster is a mysterious hidden character in UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. 
He seems to be extremely important to the overarching narrative of DELTARUNE, yet very little is known about him definitively.* 

**IN UNDERTALE**, Doctor W. D. Gaster is a secret side-character, featured only in rare random events and unused game code.

Most of the information related to Dr. Gaster comes from the so-called "<a onclick="loadFile('Gaster Followers.md')">Gaster Followers</a>", that have a chance to appear in various locations around Hotland if the hidden <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is set to 61, 62, or 63. They explain that Doctor W. D. Gaster was a brilliant inventor, who created the <a onclick="loadFile('CORE.md')">CORE</a> and held the position of the royal scientist before <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>. 

One day he "fell down into his creation"; however, instead of dying, he ended up shattered across time and space. The exact implications of this are unknown. One of the followers implies that Dr. Gaster is currently listening to them talking. Another claims to hold a piece of Gaster in their hand.

The apperance of Doctor W. D. Gaster is unknown, but is widely believed to be the <a onclick="loadFile('Mystery Man.md')">Mystery Man</a>, who has a 10% chance to appear if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is at 66.

Another Fun Event, the <a onclick="loadFile('Sound Test.md')">Sound Test</a> room, includes the "Gaster Theme" among other unused tracks.

More information about Dr. Gaster can be found in the game code. 
He has unused battle stats, all of which are strings of 6's.
There's also an unused room named *room_gaster* which prints out the missing <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a> in uppercase Wingdings, a font that replaces letters with various symbols.

The name W. D. Gaster is likely a reference to Wingdings. Thus, he is likely a skeleton, like <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>, who are the only other character named after fonts. How exactly Gaster is related to them is unknown.

Sans is directly linked to Dr. Gaster by the fact that his weapons are called "Gaster Blasters" in the game files. Sans was also involved in timeline research and might have worked at <a onclick="loadFile('Hotland Lab.md')">the Lab</a> at some point.
