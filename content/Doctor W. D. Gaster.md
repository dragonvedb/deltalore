Doctor W. D. Gaster is a mysterious hidden character in UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. 
He seems to be extremely important to the overarching narrative of the DELTAVERSE, yet very little is known about him definitively. 

In UNDERTALE, he is a secret side-character, featured only in rare random events and unused game code.
In DELTARUNE, by contrast, he is a looming presence, but is never mentioned by name.

## UNDERTALE

Most information about Dr. Gaster comes from the so called [[Gaster Followers]], who have a small chance to appear in Hotland on every playthrough (among other [[Fun Events]]).

According to them, Dr. Gaster was a former Royal Scientist immediately before Alphys; he was a brilliant mind who built the CORE that powers all of Underground.
After one of his experiments went wrong, he fell into his own creation (probably the CORE, but it could also be the DT Extractor, the machine in [[Sans' Workshop]] or something else entirely). He didn't die, however, and instead was shattered across time and space.

Even in this state, he can apparently observe and interact with the world.


Doctor W. D. Gaster is a mysterious hidden character, whose backstory and properties are mostly revealed through rare random events and unused game code. Even though Dr. Gaster doesn't seem to play any significant role in the game's story, his cryptic nature and implications of his very existence created an enduring fascination with the character, leading to enormous amounts of speculation and theorycrafting.

The name W. D. Gaster is likely a reference to Wingdings (a font that replaces letters with various symbols), since the only piece of text that is confirmed to have been written by Dr. Gaster is [[Entry 17]] *(see below)*, which consists entirely of upper-case Wingdings. Aster is also a name of a popular font. Because of this Dr. Gaster is widely considered to be a skeleton, like [[Sans]] and [[Papyrus]], since they are the only other characters who are named after fonts. How he is actually related to them is unknown. Additionally, Mystery Man *(see below)* can be said to resemble a disfigured skeleton.

Most of the information related to Dr. Gaster comes from his so-called "[[Gaster Followers]]", that have a chance to appear in various locations around Hotland if the hidden [[Fun Value]] is set to 61, 62, or 63. They explain that Doctor W. D. Gaster was a brilliant inventor, who created the [[CORE]] and held the position of the royal scientist before Alphys. One day, as a result of an experiment gone awry he "fell down into his creation" (most probably CORE, but it could also be [[DT Extraction Machine]] or something else). However, instead of dying, he ended up shattered across time and space. The exact implications of this are unknown, but one of the followers implies that Dr. Gaster is currently listening to them talking; another one claims to hold a piece of Gaster in their hand.

The apperance of Doctor W. D. Gaster is unknown. The most widely accepted theory is that Dr. Gaster's sprite is  *spr_mysteryman*. This "Mystery Man" has a 10% chance to appear behind the grey door in the Fake Hallway, which itself only appears in Waterfall if the Fun Value is set to 66. If interacted with, the sprite changes to a startled expression and disappears with a characteristic sound.

Some other "Fun" events can also be stongly tied to Dr. Gaster; particularly the Sound Test room, which includes "Gaster Theme" among other unused tracks. It is probable that all "Fun" events are connected to Dr. Gaster in some way, or even represent his ability to monitor and interfere with select timelines.

More information about Dr. Gaster can be found in the game code. There's an unused room named *room_gaster* which prints out the missing [[Entry 17]] in uppercase wingdings. Dr. Gaster also has unused battle stats, all of which are strings of 6's. Of course, 666 is the Number of the Beast in Christianity, which in some interprettions is a cypher hiding the true name of Antichrist. The significance of this is unknown. But this association with number 6 lends more credence to Mystery Man being Dr. Gaster, since Mystery Man only appears when the Fun Value is set to 66.

Sans is directly linked to Dr. Gaster by the fact that one of his most prominent weapons are called "Gaster blasters" in the game files. Considering that Dr. Gaster is likely a skeleton just like Sans; that Sans is aware of time travel; and that Sans is connected, both explicitly and implicitly, with the [[Hotland Lab]] and timeline research, many theorize that Sans is Dr. Gasters former collegue, and possibly even brother or son.

Alphys also could've worked with Doctor W. D. Gaster. She mentions in her Lab Entries that she exracted [[Determination]] from the [[Human Souls]] using older blueprints. It's possible that the DT Extraction Machine was originally designed by Dr. Gaster. 

Another instance of blueprints written in unreadable symbols is found in [[Sans' Workshop]] next to a broken machine.
