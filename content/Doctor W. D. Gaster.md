**IN UNDERTALE AND DELTARUNE**, Doctor W. D. Gaster is a mysterious hidden character.
He seems to be extremely important to the overarching narrative of both games, yet little is known about him definitively.

**IN UNDERTALE**, Doctor W. D. Gaster is a secret side-character, featured only in rare random events and unused game code.

Most of the information related to Dr. Gaster comes from the so-called "<a onclick="loadFile('Gaster Followers.md')">Gaster Followers</a>", that have a chance to appear in various locations around Hotland if the hidden <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is set to 61, 62, or 63. They explain that Doctor W. D. Gaster was a brilliant inventor, who created the <a onclick="loadFile('CORE.md')">CORE</a> and held the position of Royal Scientist before <a onclick="loadFile('Alphys.md')">Alphys</a>. 

One day he "fell down into his creation"; however, instead of dying, he ended up shattered across time and space. The exact implications of this are unknown.
One of the followers implies that Dr. Gaster is currently listening to them talking. Another claims to hold a piece of Gaster in their hand.

The apperance of Doctor W. D. Gaster is unknown, but is widely believed to be the <a onclick="loadFile('Mystery Man.md')">Mystery Man</a>, who has a 10% chance to appear if the <a onclick="loadFile('Fun Events.md')">Fun Value</a> is at 66.

Another Fun Event, the <a onclick="loadFile('Sound Test.md')">Sound Test</a> room, includes the "Gaster Theme" (internally named *mus_st_him*) among other unused tracks.

More information about Dr. Gaster can be found in the game code. He has unused battle stats, all of which are strings of 6's.

There's also an unused room named *room_gaster* which prints out a text called <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a> in uppercase Wingdings, a font that replaces letters with various symbols. The typer value for Entry 17 (which determines how the text is rendered) is '666'.

The name W. D. Gaster is likely a reference to the Wingdings font. Other characters named after fonts are <a onclick="loadFile('Sans.md')">Sans</a> and <a onclick="loadFile('Papyrus.md')">Papyrus</a>. How Gaster is related to them is unknown.

Sans is also directly linked to Dr. Gaster by the fact that his weapons are called "Gaster Blasters" in the game files.

**IN DELTARUNE**, Dr. Gaster features much more prominently, but, as of yet, his name has not been mentioned directly.

Years before the release of DELTARUNE, an image with the name _him.png_ was posted on deltarune.com. The image contained very faint text in Wingdings that read "THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT SEEMS VERY VERY INTERESTING", a quote from <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17</a>. Later, the image was changed to say "THREE HEROES APPEARED TO BANISH THE <a onclick="loadFile('Angels.md')">ANGELS</a> <a onclick="loadFile('Haven.md')">HAVEN</a>", which is a rephrasing of a part of <a onclick="loadFile('Prophecy.md')">the Prophecy</a>.

The release of SURVEY_PROGRAM was announced on Twitter by an account with a blacked out name, writing in a tone similar to that of Entry 17. It said that it will show the player something they will find "VERY, VERY, INTERESTING", but incomplete; and that it is going to "APPROACH ITS REALIZATION" by asking several questions of the player. 
On the following day, the account posted "I LOOK FORWARD TO CREATING A NEW FUTURE WITH YOU", followed by "SHOW YOURSELF ! DELTA RUNE !"

A link to deltarune.com was provided, which hosted a file labeled SURVEY_PROGRAM (which contained Ch1 of DELTARUNE). The file had a version number of 0.6.6.6 and asked the user to accept "EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FROM NOW ON" before installation.

When the SURVEY_PROGRAM is launched, Dr. Gaster greets the establishes the connection to the Player. After <a onclick="loadFile('Red Soul.md')">the Red Soul</a> appears, he starts <a onclick="loadFile('Goner Maker.md')">the Goner Maker</a> sequence and guides the Player through the process creating a <a onclick="loadFile('Vessel.md')">Vessel</a> for the Soul, until he is suddenly interrupted by <a onclick="loadFile('Third Entity.md')">an unknown speaker</a>.
- _The music track that plays during this part is named ANOTHER HIM, referencing *mus_st_him* <a onclick="loadFile('Sound Test.md')">(Gaster's Theme')' from UT._

Afterwards, Gaster seems to assist the Player with saving and loading, parts of the outer layer of the game, known as <a onclick="loadFile('DEVICE.md')">the DEVICE.

<a onclick="loadFile('mus_smile.md')">*mus_smile*, the sound that plays over <a onclick="loadFile('Entry 17.md')">Entry 17 in UT, is heard whenever <a onclick="loadFile('Kris.md')">Kris tries to make a phone call while in <a onclick="loadFile('Dark Worlds.md')">the Dark World. The narration describes it as "garbage noise". 
- _"Garbage noise" also played when <a onclick="loadFile('Spamton G. Spamton.md')">Spamton tried to contact his mysterious caller for the last time. So it is likely Gaster was the one who somehow made him succesful._
    - _Gaster was probably also the stranger, who drove <a onclick="loadFile('Jevil.md')">Jevil insane. <a onclick="loadFile('Seam.md')">Seam even quotes Entry 17 when he says that listening to Jevil "made his outlook darker, yet darker"._

*mus_smile* also plays in the vicinity of <a onclick="loadFile('Bunker.md')">the Bunker, slowed down by 666%.

- _Gaster's name cannot be entered during <a onclick="loadFile('Name Selector.md')">the name selection in both UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE._
